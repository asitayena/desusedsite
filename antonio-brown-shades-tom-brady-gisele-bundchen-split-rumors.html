The image, which Brown had reshared from another social media user, had <a href=#>swapped the main characters to represent illustrated versions</a> of Brady, 45, and the supermodel, 42.

Seeing my children succeed and become the beautiful little humans that they are, seeing him succeed, and being fulfilled in his career — it makes me happy. At this point in my life, I feel like I’ve done a good job on that.”</p><p class=p1>She added at the time: “Obviously, I have my concerns [with him returning to football] — this is a very violent sport, and I have my children and <a href=#>I would like him to be more present</a>. I have definitely had those conversations with him over and over again. But ultimately, I feel that everybody has to make a decision that works for [them]. He needs to follow his joy, too.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/antonio-brown-shades-former-teammate-tom-brady-and-gisele-bundchen-living-separately-amid-split-rumors-inline.jpg><p class=p1>While both Brady and the former Victoria’s Secret Angel appear to be at odds, the TB12 founder also h<a href=#>as had a rocky relationship</a> with Brown.</p><p class=p1>“It’s nothing personal, Tom is&nbsp;actually one of my close friends,” the&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Masked Singer</a>&nbsp;</i>alum said <a href=#>during a January appearance on the “Full Send” podcast</a>, noting why he didn’t follow his former Bucs teammate. “Some people have a different definition of a friend because when I say you’re gonna be a friend, that means I got your back. To me though, that’s what a friend means.”</p><p class=p1>Brown continued: “Brady can’t do s—t by himself. But, you guys going to make it seem like he’s just this heroic guy. Bro, we all humans.
