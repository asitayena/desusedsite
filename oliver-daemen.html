He was 18 years old on his voyage, making him the youngest and first teenager to fly to space.</p><p>Daemen is well-known for going to space with <strong>Amazon CEO</strong> J<strong>eff Bezos</strong> and his brother <strong>Mark Bezos </strong>after winning a <strong>$28 million</strong> auction ticket.

He was born into a well-established business family where families have a good time together, sharing joyful moments.</p><h2>How Was Oliver Daeman Chosen?</h2><p>Amazon's founder, Jeff Bezos, and the author of Blue Origin, recently organized a space trip called Blue Origin Spaceflight, which he will take alongside his brother and one other person. Blue Origin Spaceflight devised a strategy to carry a passenger on a corporate space mission with them, picked through a closeout.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2021/8/21/219836457_4220677864676779_3124120903391950556_n%20(1)-min-1629569751798.jpg><p>The teenager's dad had bought the ticket for New Shepard's second human flight, but Blue Origin moved him up when a seat became available on the first flight. Instead of traveling himself, the CEO of <strong>Somerset Capital Partners</strong> handed his heart to his son. Instead, the winner of the public auction will fly on the second trip.
