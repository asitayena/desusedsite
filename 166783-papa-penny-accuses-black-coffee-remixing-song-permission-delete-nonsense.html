He called it disrespectful.</p><p class=align-left>He was referring to his hit 90s song <i>Hayi Ka Mina Hee</i>.</p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION</strong>: Follow us on <a id=https://www.instagram.com/brieflynews/ href=# title="Briefly News Instagram" rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a> - get the most important news directly in your favourite app!</p>"The DJs that don't know how to sing stop playing with our minds. Bushida Coffee, stop [playing] my song <i>Hayi Ka Mina Hee</i>, that is my song."<p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Papa Penny</a> then goes on to ask Bushida to delete the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">song</a> and advises him to compose his own music.</p>"Stop the rubbish you are doing. [If you want to use] anybody's song, consult. Don't be a fake artist. You cannot remix my song without asking me. You must do your own thing. Don't play off my gift. Compose your own song, delete that nonsense, that rubbish now. Budaza Coffee, whatever!"<h2>Budaza Coffee heeds the call, deletes his remix</h2><p class=align-left>Another tweep, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">@RoxRonza</a>, shared a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">clip</a> from Bushida Coffee explaining why he remixed the song. He also did not fight back and kindly deleted the remix.</p>"I have seen the DMs. The song that I remixed has been deleted."<p class=align-left>Watch both video clips below:</p><p class=align-left>Speaking to <strong>Briefly News</strong>, Bushida Coffee clarified that the remix he made is different from Papa Penny's original song.</p>"The song didn't even have his lyrics on [it]. The melodies and baseline had some similarities but were different. Papa Penny is a legend that I grew up loving, and his music always brings the best memories of my childhood."<p class=align-left>Bushida said he is willing to work with Papa Penny to release the song seeing that fans enjoyed his remix.</p>"However, even though I deleted the song out of respect, I do not think he should have lashed at me like that without even listening to the song. The song is completely different from his song. At the end of the day, I am a great producer, and I am not desperate to release hits. I will not be releasing the song. The song is a hit, and should Mr Papa Penny be willing to release it, we can work on it and make people dance. I still have the song, which has the potential to be great, and I am open to sharing the rights provided all is done in a peaceful manner."<h2>Mzansi thinks Papa Penny slammed Black Coffee</h2><p class=align-left>Because Bushida Coffee has a similar name to <a href=#>Black Coffee</a>, many thought he was referring to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Black Coffee</a>.</p><p class=align-left>Thanks to a few who quickly picked up that he was, in fact, referring to Bushida.</p><p class=align-left>@DjZanD said:</p>"Djs play bootlegs all the time. Bootlegs are part of the Dj club culture. It’s been happening for years. Bootleg just means it’s an unofficial remix.<p class=align-left>@stokodj said:</p>"It has been happening until someone goes to court.
