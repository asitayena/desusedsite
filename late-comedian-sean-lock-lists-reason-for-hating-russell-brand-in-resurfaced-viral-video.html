social media, Lock could be seen discussing his contempt for his fellow comic, who this week was <a class=body-link href=# data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink

allegations he has <a class=body-link href=# data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=0d7584a7e73a09bb5408a588d5bdc32d data-tgev-label=entertainment data-tgev-metric=ev>vehemently denied</a>.</p><p>Appearing on the British comedy panel show <i><a class=body-link href=#>8 Out of 10 Cats</a></i>in 2014, seven years before he died from cancer, Lock joked that he would absolutely hate if Brand went anywhere near his daughters.</p><p>“Probably the reason I hate him so much is because I’m a dad and I’ve got this fear that one day my daughters will bring something like that home,” he said.</p><p>“And he’ll come in and go, ‘Oh, oh, such pleasure to be in your charming abode.’”</p><p>In the lead up to his remarks, Lock also criticised 48-year-old Brand for his apathetic approach to voting in the UK as he was urging people not to vote at the time.</p><p>“The main problem now is that people get the politicians they deserve, because they don’t take any interest in politics,” Lock said.</p><p>“And [Brand] saying to people who are disaffected already, and aren’t engaged with the political process, ‘Don’t vote’, is the most moronic, self-serving, pathetic bit of attention-seeking w***.”</p><p>The late comic has been praised online over the resurfaced interview.</p><p>“The genius that was Sean Lock,” one tweeted, while another user wrote: “The late, great legend Sean Lock’s (we miss you every single day) take down of Russell Brand is the greatest character assassination I’ve ever seen.”</p><p>This was not the first time Lock publicly criticised Brand and labelled him problematic.</p><p>In 2008, Lock said the <i>Forgetting Sarah Marshall</i> actor was setting a “bad example” for other young comedians.</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>“Russell is a funny bloke and a talented man but I think he is a bad example to young comics in that to try to achieve success you have to disembowel yourself for public consumption, with every single detail of your life being sold and bartered for attention,” he told Scottish newspaper <i><a class=body-link href=#>The Scotsman</a></i>in 2008.</p><p>Brand has firmly denied the “very serious criminal allegations” against him, insisting any encounters during his “promiscuous” period were “consensual” and that he was being targeted in a “co-ordinated media attack”.</p><p>“Is there another agenda at play? Particularly when we’ve seen co-ordinated media attacks before, like with Joe Rogan, when he dared to take a medicine that the mainstream media didn’t approve of, and we saw a spate of headlines from media outlets across the world using the same language,” Brand said in a video posted to YouTube over the weekend.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7xKernqqklravucSnq2ispmS5osDEZpqopZWZtqK6jKycmqZdobykt4yloKyso2K%2Fpq3SqKVmnp%2Bneqmt06KloGWiqsC0sculZJuqkaOxbrXNZqmeq6Wns6KvxJ1kr6GilrluwsidnKhnnprEtHnSraarsV%2BasXmuw5xtnW5plq6nhJhvaG9rZ26Gc6%2BWnWqba5ZrhQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./julia-roberts-mini-alidia-baublebar-rings-sale.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The BaubleBar Alidia Ring Is $12 for InStyle Readers</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./odablock-age-real-name-twitch-instagram-banned.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Odablock Age, Real Name, Twitch, Instagram, Banned</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./shows-alex-jones-delights-with-adorable-photo-of-mini-me-daughter-ann.html>Alex Jones delights with adorable photo of mini-me daughter Annie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alexandra-silva-wiki-age-bio-height.html>Alexandra Silva Wiki (Model) Age, Bio, Height, Weight, Net worth, Ethnicity, Boyfriend, Affairs &amp;amp; Fa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./becky-g-power-rangers-actor.html>Becky G Talks Gay 'Power Rangers' Character and Immigration</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beth-behrs-net-worth.html>Beth Behrs Net Worth 2024: Income, Real Estate and Financial Success</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chaunte-wayans.html>Chaunte Wayans Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Husband, Salary and Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib.
