of NBA star Chris Paul.&nbsp;Since basketball in the US has almost the same status as soccer in Brazil, it’s not surprising that its players and everyone associated with them enjoy so much attention.&nbsp;especially as a girlfriend or spouse.&nbsp;This is exactly where this beautiful mother of two is today.</span></p><p><span>Though Jada Crawley has also made a name for herself, her basketball wife status puts her on the wings of her husband’s popularity.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Jada Crawley’s bio</span></strong></h2><p><span>Jada Crawley was born Jada Alexia Crawley in Winston-Salem, North Carolina USA on February 16, 1984 to a middle-class family.&nbsp;Although the specifics of her early childhood, siblings, parents, or what they did for a living are unknown, we do know that she spent most of her formative years in North Carolina;&nbsp;as does her husband.&nbsp;Growing up, Crawley attended Mount Tabor High School in Winston-Salem.&nbsp;After graduating from high school, she attended Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, where she earned a bachelor’s degree.&nbsp;However, her degree is not known.</span></p><p><span>It was during her college years that the beautiful African American girl would catch the eyes of her future husband.&nbsp;The duo met at a basketball game and recorded it from there.&nbsp;That was in 2003 and Crawley was only 19 at the time.&nbsp;While many believe Chris Paul was the first to take action, that couldn’t be further from the truth.&nbsp;In fact, Crawley had asked a mutual friend to introduce her to Paul, who was playing on the school team at the time.</span></p><p><span>After eight years of dating, the couple made Crawley, who is now a family woman, spend much of her time at home behind the public, caring for the children.&nbsp;But then the children grow.&nbsp;Crawley can be seen with her husband and children at various public events today.&nbsp;In addition, she runs a burgeoning fashion company and uses her profits for causes that help alleviate suffering and pain for the less privileged.</span></p><span>A founding member of the Chris Paul Foundation- Crawley is the host of the Jada Paul Prom Dress Giveaway program which seeks to bridge this huge gap between privileged and disadvantaged youth.&nbsp;The annual program involves high school students for boot camps where they are trained in trades such as makeup, braid bar, fashion shows and the like.&nbsp;Also, attendees can choose from a variety of ball gowns, shoes, and jewelry.&nbsp;Item required for her prom

The couple met in 2003 and walked down the aisle eight years after they first met.&nbsp;The star-studded wedding was nothing unusual as it was attended by some of basketball’s most popular faces.&nbsp;Not to mention LeBron James, who appeared as one of the groomsmen.&nbsp;Together they have two children.&nbsp;A boy, Christopher Emmanuel Paul II (b. May 23, 2009) and a girl, Camryn Alexis Paul (b. August 16, 2012).&nbsp;In an almost predictable twist of fate, Christopher has decided to follow his father’s path;&nbsp;play professional basketball.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Facts about Jada Crawley</span></strong></h2><ul><li><strong><span>1.
