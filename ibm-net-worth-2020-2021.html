It is&nbsp;headquartered in Armonk, New York. IBM&nbsp;operates&nbsp;in over 170 countries.&nbsp;In 1911,&nbsp;The company&nbsp;was founded in Endicott, New York,&nbsp;it started&nbsp;as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR) and was&nbsp;later&nbsp;renamed&nbsp;&nbsp;“International Business Machines” in 1924.</p><p>IBM is incorporated in New York.&nbsp;Things invented by IBM are the floppy disk, the hard disk drive, the automated teller machine (ATM), the magnetic stripe card, the relational database, the SQL programming language, the UPC barcode, and dynamic random-access memory (DRAM).</p><h2>Inception3</h2><p>In the 1880s, technologies emerged that would ultimately form the core of IBM. In 1885, Julius E. Pitrap developed the processing scale. In 1888 Alexander Dey concocted the dial recorder, Herman Hollerith protected the Electric Tabulating Machine between 1860–1929, and in 1889, Willard Bundy designed a period clock.</p><p>IBM’s four companies got combined in New York State with Charles Ranlett Flint, forming the 5th company on June 16, 1911, the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR) based in Endicott, New York. The five companies had 1,300 employees and offices and plants in Binghamton, New York, Ohio, Detroit, Washington, D.C., and Toronto.</p><p>IBM has shifted its business operations by focusing on higher-values since its beginning, to more profitable markets. The sale of personal computers in 2005 and x86-based server businesses to Lenovo in 2014, and acquiring companies such as SPSS (2009), Red Hat (2019), PwC Consulting (2002) and The Weather Company (2016). IBM announced that it would go “fabless” and will continue to design semiconductors but offloading manufacturing to GlobalFoundries in 2015.

IBMers have been awarded many awards, such as five Nobel Prizes, six Turing Awards, ten National Medals of Technology (USA), and five National Medals of Science (USA).</p><h2>Evolution</h2><p>IBM has&nbsp;manufactured machinery for sale and lease,&nbsp;which&nbsp;ranges&nbsp;from meat and cheese slicers to tabulators and punch cards,&nbsp;commercial scales, and industrial time recorders. Thomas J. Watson, Sr.&nbsp;got&nbsp;fired from the National Cash Register Company by John Henry Patterson, who called on Flint to be&nbsp;offered a position at CTR&nbsp;in 1914. Watson joined CTR as General Manager then&nbsp;after&nbsp;11 months&nbsp;after he&nbsp;was made President when court cases relating to his time at NCR were resolved.</p><p>IBM’s tabulating equipment enabled organizations to process huge amounts of data&nbsp;in 1937, its clients included&nbsp;the U.S. government, during its first&nbsp;attempt&nbsp;to maintain employment records for 26 million people pursuant to the Social Security Act and the tracking of persecuted groups by Hitler’s Third Reich, largely through the German subsidiary Dehomag.&nbsp;From 1935 to 1939,&nbsp;the social security-related business gave an 81% increase in revenue.</p><p>IBM announced the first computer system family on April 7, 1964, which was called the IBM System/360. A complete range of scientific targets from large to small, allowing brands to upgrade to models with greater computing capability without having to remake their applications initially. It was followed by the launch of the IBM System/370 in 1970.</p><p>Both the 360 and 370 made IBM’s top product for the best mainframe computer and the dominant computing field in the industry throughout this time period and into the early 1980s. Operating systems that were made inside are VMS and OS/VS1, and the middleware built on best of those such as the CICS transaction processing monitor, had near-monopoly-level, hold on the computer industry, and people became almost opposite with IBM products due to their market balance.</p><h2>Awards & Achievements</h2><p>IBM has won many awards and is one of the biggest companies in the world.
