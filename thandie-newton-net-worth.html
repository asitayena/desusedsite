Today, Newton is famous for a range of starring roles in some of the most memorable films of recent memory.

She admits that she was asked to sit out of school photos, and she was often humiliated for a number of reasons. As a young girl, Newton also studied dance in London. After graduating from secondary school, she attended Cambridge and earned a degree in social anthropology.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-237551 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Thandie-Newton.jpg alt="Thandie Newton Net Worth" width=594 height=396 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-237551 class=wp-caption-text>Rich Polk/Getty Images</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Thandie's film career took off in 1991 with "Flirting," after which she booked a role in "Interview with the Vampire" in 1994.
