Who does that leave in charge of his Sinaloa Cartel, the largest in the world? Ismael Zambada Garcia, who has a drug lord moniker of his own in "El Mayo," worth some $3 billion and according to a recent Bloomberg article is consolidating his international <a href=#>narcotics</a> empire.</p><p>El Mayo was a partner to El Chapo, but compared to the total revenue generated by their cartel, his $3 billion fortune is only a fraction – right now.&nbsp; The US government is seeking to seize $14 billion from El Chapo in court, an action reported as the process of jury selection for Chapo's trial began. The two poured cash from their alleged drug operations into hundreds of companies, many of which the DEA says are still operating and generating income today. Mike Vigil, formerly the DEA's head of international operations, describes Mayo's business acumen like so:</p><p><strong>"He has a very diversified portfolio… Even though he's only had maybe an elementary-school education, he's received a Harvard-level education from some of the most prolific, knowledgeable and astute drug lords that Mexico has ever had."</strong></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-272177 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GettyImages-52242812-1-e1541703554359.jpg alt width=900 height=644 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-272177 class=wp-caption-text>ALEJANDRO ACOSTA/AFP/Getty Images</p><p>The businesses that reportedly serve as fronts for the Sinaloa Cartel include a water park, and even a daycare center allegedly managed by Mayo's daughter Maria Teresa. The cartel has plenty of money to funnel through these front businesses, since on average it's reportedly pulling in at least $11 billion a year from sale of drugs across the northern border of Mexico – a figure that is thought to be conservative since it doesn't include any sales made elsewhere, and calculated under the assumption that all the drugs seized by authorities on their way to the US makes up roughly half of the total amount.</p><p>Such an expansive business is how El Mayo has been able to amass such an impressive fortune since 2001. Now, though, he is said to be in a precarious position, in hiding from authorities in the mountains of Sinaloa with a $5 million reward from the U.S. State Department hanging over his head.</p><p>If El Mayo is captured or killed – or succumbs to the diabetes from which he is believed to suffer – it's unknown what will happen to the cartel he leads or who will inherit his mantle.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK7IpaOip56WtrOxjKecsKtfmrlur8eap6irXWx9bsXEmqlmp5yZerGt0a2lnqpdr66ursCdmGafkaewqq2Moqpmr5%2Bnwal5kmaZoqScnryvedGepJqhnqh6qrqMnJ%2BaqpeaerCyjKygp5mcpK5ur8Crq56kXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./elliot-mintz.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Elliot Mintz</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dina-eastwood-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Dina Eastwood Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./shows-alex-jones-delights-with-adorable-photo-of-mini-me-daughter-ann.html>Alex Jones delights with adorable photo of mini-me daughter Annie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alexandra-silva-wiki-age-bio-height.html>Alexandra Silva Wiki (Model) Age, Bio, Height, Weight, Net worth, Ethnicity, Boyfriend, Affairs &amp;amp; Fa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./becky-g-power-rangers-actor.html>Becky G Talks Gay 'Power Rangers' Character and Immigration</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beth-behrs-net-worth.html>Beth Behrs Net Worth 2024: Income, Real Estate and Financial Success</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chaunte-wayans.html>Chaunte Wayans Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Husband, Salary and Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib.
