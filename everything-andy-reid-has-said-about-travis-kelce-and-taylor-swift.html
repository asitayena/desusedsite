Swift’s attendance was in response to Kelce publicly extending an invitation after failing to give her his number <a href=#>at her Kansas City Eras Tour concert</a> earlier that summer.</p><p>The two have since confirmed their relationship — with Swift making appearances at multiple Chiefs games — and everyone from the stars’ close friends and family to the NFL itself has gushed over their romance.</p><p>Reid, for his part, joked in a September 2023 press conference that he was the one who set Kelce up with Swift, sharing that he had “met” her previously. He later revealed that he knew the singer from his days as a coach for the Philadelphia Eagles — the Swift family’s longtime favorite football team. (Travis’ brother, <a href=#><strong>Jason Kelce</strong></a>, happens to be a center for Eagles).</p><p>In November 2023, Reid shared that he is just happy the pair found each other. “I’m glad he’s found somebody he likes and she’s found somebody she likes,” he said during an interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>KHSB</a>, Kansas City’s NBC affiliate. “That’s a good thing.”</p><p>Keep scrolling for everything Travis’ coach has said about his romance with Swift:</p><h3>Enchanted to Meet Her</h3><p>Reid revealed he and Swift had crossed paths before she sparked a romance with Travis.</p><p>“You know what, <a href=#>I’ve met her before</a>,” he said during a September 2023 post-game press conference and joked that he “set them up” before walking away from the podium.</p><h3>Nice to Have a Friend</h3><p>Reid revealed in October 2023 that he knew Swift from his days coaching the Philadelphia Eagles.</p><p>“I knew her from Philadelphia. <a href=#>Her dad was a big NFL fan</a>,” Reid shared during an interview on <strong>Donovan McNabb’s</strong> “The Five Spot” podcast on <a href=# rel=noopener>OutKick</a>. “So, I had met her when she was real young, and her dad.”</p><p>While Reid clarified that he was previously joking about “setting Kelce up” with the Grammy winner, he noted that she’s a “good girl” who is “into” the sport. “We’re glad she’s here,” he said.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><h3>All She Has to Do Is Stay</h3><p>“She <a href=#>can stay around all she wants</a>,” Reid said of Swift in footage shared via social media after the Chiefs defeated the Los Angeles Chargers in October 2023, adding that Travis keeps “getting better with time.”</p><h3>Seeing Sparks Fly</h3><p>“I’m just glad <a href=#>he’s found somebody he likes</a> and she’s found somebody she likes,” Reid said during a November 2023 interview with KHSB, Kansas City’s NBC affiliate. “That’s a good thing.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaerpWnxrW0yKeeZpmemcZuvsSim2agkah6tK3InWSamp%2BqwW7A0ZqtoqtdoLKtr8RmmKecXamuurjOq2Ssr5mbwXA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./explore-about-joaquin-niemann-career-earnings-and-net-worth-before-the-pga-championship-2022.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Explore About Joaquin Niemann Career Earnings And Net Worth Before The PGA Championship</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ed-jovanovski-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ed Jovanovski Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./shows-alex-jones-delights-with-adorable-photo-of-mini-me-daughter-ann.html>Alex Jones delights with adorable photo of mini-me daughter Annie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alexandra-silva-wiki-age-bio-height.html>Alexandra Silva Wiki (Model) Age, Bio, Height, Weight, Net worth, Ethnicity, Boyfriend, Affairs &amp;amp; Fa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./becky-g-power-rangers-actor.html>Becky G Talks Gay 'Power Rangers' Character and Immigration</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beth-behrs-net-worth.html>Beth Behrs Net Worth 2024: Income, Real Estate and Financial Success</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chaunte-wayans.html>Chaunte Wayans Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Husband, Salary and Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib.
