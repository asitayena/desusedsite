Dune fans rejoice — because the sequel is already in the works.</p><p>Dune was initially released in October 2021 and was not only a hit with fans but with the critics as well. The Oscar-nominated film starring <a href=#><strong>Timothée Chalamet</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Zendaya</strong></a> was a box office smash, earning more than $400 million worldwide. The immediate success of the film led to the confirmation of the sequel shortly after.</p><p><strong>Denis Villeneuve</strong> will return to direct the second film. In March 2022, he revealed that the screenplay was “mostly” finished.</p><p>“But it’s always a work in progress,” Villeneuve said in an interview with <a href=#>Collider</a> at the time. “It’ll be a work in progress until final cut, but I will say it’s solidified. I have a script in my hands. We are in prep right now. My crew, we are in full prep for the movie.”</p><p>Dune, based on Frank Herbert’s lengthy science fiction novel of the same name, was always intended to be split into two movies, according to Villeneuve. Chalamet stars as the film’s hero, Paul Atreides, while Zendaya plays Chani, his future love interest. The cast is rounded out by <a href=#><strong>Rebecca Ferguson</strong></a>, <strong>Stellan Skarsgård</strong>, <a href=#><strong>Oscar Isaac</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Javier Bardem</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Jason Momoa</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Josh Brolin</strong></a> and <strong>Stephen McKinley Henderson</strong>.</p><p>Zendaya’s role in the first part of the franchise was minimal and left viewers wanting more.</p><p>“For Zendaya, I will say Part One was a promise. I know that we saw a glimpse of her in Part One, but in Part Two, she’ll have a prominent part,” Villeneuve told <a href=#>Variety</a> in a March 2022 interview. “We will follow Timothée and Zendaya on their adventures in the desert. That’s the thing that excited me most about going back to Arrakis is to spend time with those characters again.”</p><p>Zendaya also hinted about her story line development with <a href=#>Deadline</a> in November 2021. “Anybody who has read the books knows there’s so much more to explore and deal with,” she said at the time.</p><p>In the same interview, Chalamet expressed his excitement to get back on set. “We were ready to do it back then [when we wrapped Part One]. This story is far from finished,” he teased.</p><p>Although most are set to return, Isaac won’t be one of them following his character’s death. However, two new characters will be introduced: Princess Irulan and Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen played by <a href=#><strong>Florence Pugh</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Austin Butler</strong></a>, respectively.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While Dune: Part One had a same-day theater and HBO Max release, Part Two will have an exclusive theater release. However, it’s yet to be confirmed when it will arrive on streaming platforms.</p><p>Keep scrolling to see everything we know about Dune Part Two:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BZwq%2BxjKycqq2VoXq4tMCtZLCdXaC7sMOMrKZmnpGnfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./erica-weston-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Erica Weston Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./donna-kelce-wears-good-luck-charms-during-travis-and-jasons-games.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Donna Kelce Wears Good Luck Charms During Travis and Jason's Games</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./shows-alex-jones-delights-with-adorable-photo-of-mini-me-daughter-ann.html>Alex Jones delights with adorable photo of mini-me daughter Annie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alexandra-silva-wiki-age-bio-height.html>Alexandra Silva Wiki (Model) Age, Bio, Height, Weight, Net worth, Ethnicity, Boyfriend, Affairs &amp;amp; Fa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./becky-g-power-rangers-actor.html>Becky G Talks Gay 'Power Rangers' Character and Immigration</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beth-behrs-net-worth.html>Beth Behrs Net Worth 2024: Income, Real Estate and Financial Success</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chaunte-wayans.html>Chaunte Wayans Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Husband, Salary and Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib.
