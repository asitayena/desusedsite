Holmes</strong></a> had frequently shared his love and admiration for estranged wife <a href=#><strong>Marilee Fiebig</strong></a> after they tied the knot in 2010.</p><p>“In all I do, I have a partner looking out for me, advising me, <a href=#>keeping me on track and stopping me from making a mistake</a>, no matter how great or small,” the journalist wrote about his marriage to the attorney, with whom he shares daughter Sabine, in a letter for The Root.com in March 2014.</p><p>Adding that he was “still the same guy at my core,” Holmes confessed that being with Fiebig brought many positive changes to his life.</p><p>“My family and I are closer, my individual net worth has gone up every year since we met, I’ve learned a second language, I’m healthier, I use the N-word less, I listen to Sunday church service more, I’m a better friend, I’m more forgiving than I used to be, I’m more involved in charitable work,” he continued. “In every way, I’m better off because I’m married. So, <a href=#>for me, a successful marriage has revolved around this principle</a>: I like who I am with her.”</p><p>The ABC personality echoed those sentiments six years later, <a href=#>penning a gushing post about the Save the Children chief diversity officer</a> in honor of their 10th anniversary.</p><p>“Asking her for another 10 years would be asking too much. Another 10 months? That may even be a stretch. <a href=#>If she gave me another 10 weeks, I should consider myself lucky</a>. If she puts up with me another 10 days, I’d be grateful,” <a href=#>the former MSNBC correspondent</a> wrote via Facebook in March 2020. “But if she would even spare another 10 minutes of her time for me today, I should consider myself blessed. This is MARILEE FIEBIG HOLMES, y’all. And I, T. J. Holmes, do solemnly swear … that I …. was HER #decadechallenge.”</p><p>However,<a href=#> the couple’s marriage appeared to hit a roadblock in November 2022</a>, when he shared a cryptic quote via Instagram. “End the relationship and cry once. It’s better than being with them and crying daily.” Holmes wrote at the time, adding that it was his “Quote of the week” with a crying face emoji.</p><p>The Arkansas native raised eyebrows that same month when <a href=#>he was photographed getting cozy with his GMA coanchor</a> <a href=#><strong>Amy Robach</strong> </a>during various outings in New York City. One image published by the Daily Mail showed the pair holding hands in a car. In another, they laughed together at a bar. A third photo showed Holmes playfully touching Robach — who has been married to <a href=#><strong>Andrew Shue</strong></a> since 2010 — on the backside as she packed a car outside of an upstate New York cottage</p><p>Neither Holmes or the 20/20 coanchor publicly commented on the photos right away, and they each<a href=#> disabled social media accounts amid the scandal</a>. Fiebig’s Instagram profile has since been made private.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>confirmed in December 2022 that <a href=#>Holmes filed for divorce in New York City</a>, two days after he was spotted with Robach in an Atlanta airport.</p><p>Keep scrolling to learn more about Fiebig amid her estranged husband’s workplace scandal:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkxKm7jKKqZqWRp7atscRmnaKdkp60boGMrZ%2BippeoerW7jKSlqK9dlq%2BwwdNmq2aiXZ28rbnErGSwoZaafA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./wayfair-boycott-walkout.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Why Customers Are Boycotting This Popular Online Furniture Store</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./desmond-styles.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Harry Styles's Father Desmond Styles?
