Since childhood, he has been passionate about sports.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>At age five, Dwight got a chance to join the academy at Manchester United, the club he supported when he was a kid. He stayed in the United academy until he was 14.</span></p><p><span>As per the recently updated news, the 22-year-old signed the five-year contract with Everton in a deal worth £ 20 million plus add-ons on July 28, Thursday.</span></p><p><span>The pro winger Dwight previously played for Burnley and Manchester United. In 2014, Dwight went on a trail in Burnley Football Club.</span></p><p><span>After two years, he was cited with a two-year scholarship, was a regular member of the under-18 squad, and periodically played for the Development Squad. During his senior years with Burnley, Dwight appeared in 134 games and scored seven goals.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Throughout his senior career, Dwight competed with two national teams, England U20 and England U21, between 2019 and 2021.</span></p><h2 id=everton-winger-dwight-mcn>Everton Winger Dwight McNeil's Ethnicity Is Mixed</h2><p><span>Dwight McNeil's ethnicity is&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><span>mixed</span></a><span>&nbsp;since his ancestors were from Jamaica. As per his legit wiki page, Dwight's father was born to both English and Jamaican parents.</span></p><p><span>By sense, McNeil is eligible to play for Jamaica and his native England.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>[image-1]</span></p><p><span>What's his religion? There are no details about Dwight's religion at the moment. He is possibly a religious person, but which faith he follows is a mystery to many fans.</span></p><p><span>Similarly, McNeil's nationality is British, as he was born and raised in Rochdale, England.</span></p><h2 id=tracy-and-matty-mcneil-ar>Tracy And Matty McNeil Are Dwight McNeil's Parents</h2><p><span>Dwight McNeil is the eldest son of his parents, Tracy and Matty McNeil. He was raised along with his two younger sisters, Baillie and Chiara.</span></p><p><span>[image-2]</span></p><p><span>Moreover, Dwight walked in his father's footsteps as he was inspired by him only. His dad,&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><span>Matty McNeil</span></a><span>, is a former British footballer who plays as a striker. He used to watch his dad play in non-league for Hyde United.</span></p><p><span>Describing McNeil's physical stat, his height is 1.83 m (6 feet) tall, and he has a slender body.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Born on November 22, Dwight is currently 22 years of age. His 23rd birthday will be celebrated after four months.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 id=dwight-mcneil-is-original>Dwight McNeil Is Originally From Rochdale, England</h2><p><span>Dwight McNeil is originally from England. Hence, his nationality is British. His ancestor was from Jamaica.</span></p><p><span>[image-3]</span></p><p><span>Speaking about McNeil's relationship status, he is probably single since there are any snaps or photos on his IG feeds. Maybe, Dwight is focusing on his career now rather than wasting time on dating.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>According to recent news, Dwight signed a contract with Everton. His deal reached £19/20m add-ons included. Lampard trusts him and considers him a good talent for the present and future of Everton.</span></p><p><span>Burnley FC&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><span>confirmed the news</span></a><span>&nbsp;via Twitter. The football club tweeted, We confirmed that Dwight joined Everton for an undisclosed fee. Thanks for everything, Dwight, with a love emoji.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirmKTEo7XZnKarppWne6S7zGiuoZmkYra0ecOwoKCgpGK6pLrEoqOsZZWpta%2B1wqKrsmWVq7KzwM6nZJ%2BbXZi8rrzLnqueZZSarq15xaipZqCZog%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./joe-devito-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What is Joe Devito Net Worth 2024: Wiki, Real Name, Age, Height, Family</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./catherine-bach-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What is Catherine Bach Net Worth 2024: Financial Insights by Rachel Parris</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./shows-alex-jones-delights-with-adorable-photo-of-mini-me-daughter-ann.html>Alex Jones delights with adorable photo of mini-me daughter Annie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alexandra-silva-wiki-age-bio-height.html>Alexandra Silva Wiki (Model) Age, Bio, Height, Weight, Net worth, Ethnicity, Boyfriend, Affairs &amp;amp; Fa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./becky-g-power-rangers-actor.html>Becky G Talks Gay 'Power Rangers' Character and Immigration</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beth-behrs-net-worth.html>Beth Behrs Net Worth 2024: Income, Real Estate and Financial Success</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chaunte-wayans.html>Chaunte Wayans Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Husband, Salary and Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib.
