Although Shep <a href=#>admitted to kissing another girl</a> during <a href=#>that season’s reunion</a>, the two remained together until officially <a href=#>calling it quits in July 2022</a>. Taylor later slammed her ex for <a href=#>allegedly hooking up with several women</a> not long after their split during the show’s <a href=#>season 8 reunion</a> that October.</p><p>Last month, Taylor exclusively told <a href=#>Us</a> that she has moved on with a new guy named <strong>Gaston</strong>. As for how Shep feels about her new boyfriend? He told Us, “<a href=#>I’m happy for her if she’s happy</a>,” adding, “I don’t know the guy. It’s still raw, but obviously, she’s going to live her life, and I’m certainly living mine. I’ll say that.”</p><p>Shep has seemingly <a href=#>pursued romantic connections</a> of his own as costar <a href=#><strong>Patricia Altschul</strong></a> hilariously called him out for asking “a bunch of girls” for their phone numbers on their flight to Las Vegas. “No comment,” he responded to her comments, claiming the interactions were “a business deal.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Southern-Charm-s-Shep-Rose-Will-Still-Stick-Up-For-Ex-Taylor-Ann-Green-Is-Living-His-Life-Post-Split-196.jpg><p>Taylor, for her part, revealed that her man will join her at BravoCon on Saturday, November 4. “We’re headed to L.A. after this, so we’re doing a little road trip through the desert, maybe get lost,” she told Us on Friday.</p><p>She also teased that Gaston will appear on the upcoming second season of <a href=#>Southern Hospitality</a>. “He’s <strong>TJ [Dinch]</strong>’s roommate, so I’m sure he has a little bit of [screen time],” she shared.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Southern-Charm-s-Shep-Rose-Will-Still-Stick-Up-For-Ex-Taylor-Ann-Green-Is-Living-His-Life-Post-Split-197.jpg><p>Taylor’s new romance already has the stamp of approval from Southern Charm and Southern Hospitality star <a href=#><strong>Leva Bonaparte</strong></a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I think he’s wonderful. Yeah, I think he’s a really nice guy. He’s really handsome and he’s got really good, confident energy,” Leva, 4, gushed on Friday. “I feel like if you’re going to date Taylor, you got to be a confident guy. … Let her do her, like, thing and, like, let her come back. And I think he has that good energy for her.”</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasp6Wptaa%2BzWaaoZmiosBuv8eep2aqn6iybsPIpaNmq6SesKx51Klkn6eiYrK5edOasKWnomKur7qMoKmenZ5k</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tara-wallace-net-worth-2020-2021.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tara Wallace Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Dating, Bio-Wiki</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sophie-turner-joe-jonas-cycling-shorts-daughter-willa-miami.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sophie Turner wows in sleek cycling shorts during rare appearance with daughter Willa</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./shows-alex-jones-delights-with-adorable-photo-of-mini-me-daughter-ann.html>Alex Jones delights with adorable photo of mini-me daughter Annie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alexandra-silva-wiki-age-bio-height.html>Alexandra Silva Wiki (Model) Age, Bio, Height, Weight, Net worth, Ethnicity, Boyfriend, Affairs &amp;amp; Fa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./becky-g-power-rangers-actor.html>Becky G Talks Gay 'Power Rangers' Character and Immigration</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beth-behrs-net-worth.html>Beth Behrs Net Worth 2024: Income, Real Estate and Financial Success</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chaunte-wayans.html>Chaunte Wayans Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Husband, Salary and Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib.
