It seems one or several of her ex-boyfriends really annoyed her because the IG post was brutal!</p><p>On her Instagram Stories, Tiffany told her exes she does not want to have anything to do with them. Now, the actress and comedian is very happy in a relationship with Common. However, she made her feeling clear about her exes in this post. Here is what she wrote:</p><p>“THIS IS FOR MOST OF MY EXES. BITS AND PIECES ARE FOR DIFFERENT ONES. I am so sick of my ex F**k Boys and yes YOU still a f**kboy even if we was in a relationship cause you still was trying to f**k when it was over, Boy. Stop reaching out to me trying to be my friend, I don’t want to be your friend. Plus you got a whole women and Babies on they way and we been done for years.”</p><p>But Tiffany is not done yet! She added that she is not interested in having them in her life, and she would happily remove them from her memory if she could:</p><p>“But you want a windfall of money, and want me to make that wind go? Huh hahahaha if I thought that would remove you from my entire life I would. Just act like I never said I love you. Cause who I was loving wasn’t the real you. When the real showed up I was disappointed and disgusted, so please go away forever. PEACE AND HAPPINESS BE UPON YOU AND YOUR FAMILY”</p><p>Considering Tiffany Haddish has had several celeb exes, fans tried to guess who she was referring to. There is still bad blood between her and some of her exes, so it is pretty clear what her intentions are now.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Hopefully, all those men that are now pestering her will get the message. Well, at least she did wish them peace and happiness!</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeknrOnrc2yZKGZlJm2tLSMrZylpKNiwKmx0maqqGWjnrCsec6fZKGdomKyuXnFpGSbp6moerWxy6WqZqyYmrpuwM5mp6WdkaiybrPOZpiwmalis7C%2BxK%2Bcq2Vkan1zf5Fo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ty-murray-net-worth-2020-2021.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ty Murray Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-10-best-teen-movies-of-all-time-w459321.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The 10 Best Teen Movies of All Time</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./shows-alex-jones-delights-with-adorable-photo-of-mini-me-daughter-ann.html>Alex Jones delights with adorable photo of mini-me daughter Annie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alexandra-silva-wiki-age-bio-height.html>Alexandra Silva Wiki (Model) Age, Bio, Height, Weight, Net worth, Ethnicity, Boyfriend, Affairs &amp;amp; Fa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./becky-g-power-rangers-actor.html>Becky G Talks Gay 'Power Rangers' Character and Immigration</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beth-behrs-net-worth.html>Beth Behrs Net Worth 2024: Income, Real Estate and Financial Success</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chaunte-wayans.html>Chaunte Wayans Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Husband, Salary and Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib.
