From being open&nbsp;about her&nbsp;challenging&nbsp;journey as a transgender, the slumps in her career, to her plastic surgery choices, the social media&nbsp;influencer has proven herself to be an open book.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>And the statement remains true as for the&nbsp;inspiration behind her tattoos as well. Dragun has six body marks as of this writing, and all of them are inspired by her favorite mythical creature — the dragon.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Nikita Dragun on Her Dragon-Themed Tattoos&nbsp;</h2><p>In an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview with Galore</a> magazine back in September 2017, Dragun gushed about her tattoos and shared why all of them were dragon-themed designs. "Honestly,&nbsp;dragons have always meant so much to me," she began.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The makeup artist elaborated on her statement, saying dragons&nbsp;represent multiple traits, such as intelligence, competence, control, power, and independence. In addition, she noted dragons were non-existent and claimed they played a vital role in history through many cultures.</p><p>In her own words, the creatures played&nbsp;out as being the ultimate, undeniabe, powerful forces of mythology.&nbsp;Without question, the 25-year-old —&nbsp;self-proclaimed mother of Draguns —&nbsp;implied that she preferred dragon tattoos because they symbolized strength.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>At the time of the interview, the Belgian-born artist had only three tattoos, but she has added three more designs on her body. Here's a quick rundown of her body arts and the meaning behind them.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Dragun's First Three Tattoos</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>A black dragon's head is the first tattoo Dragun marked on her body. In the aforementioned interview, she revealed she got the design from a tattoo artist named Evan Kim right after her school days.</p><p>As per her accounts, she wanted it to remind the hardships she faced during her school and the freedom she felt after being on her own. Dragun mentioned she loved the design, reasoning it was front and center "warding off bad luck."</p><p>In the same sit-down, the makeup artist remarked her tattoo represented someone. And she stated her sternum design was her father because "it's&nbsp;so masculine and right in your face." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The second tattoo Dargun got is the most noticeable dragon on her back. Because the design comprises a giant red dragon with feminine details, the YouTube star mentioned it represented her mother.&nbsp;</p><p>"Its just such a powerful feeling knowing that my mother has my back no matter what," she added.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The third tattoo Dragun got is on the side of her left wrist. The design comprises the word 'dragon' written in Arabic.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Nikita Dragun's Latest Tattoos&nbsp;</h2><p>Dragun has inked both sides of her rib cage; she has tattooed a black and white head of a dragon on her left side.</p><p>As for the other side, Dragun went out of her usual design and&nbsp;inked a picture of&nbsp;Quan Am —&nbsp;the God of mercy in Vietnamese Buddhism.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>The internet personality has a black and red dragon tattooed on the left side of her hip as the recent addition to her body arts. Needless to say, the top fashion model flaunts her body art on her socials through glamourous photoshoots.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKaZoLa1rYydqZqfpaPAbsDArauop16dwa64</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ohgeesy-biography.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>OHGEESY Bio (Wiki)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./morgan-rose-net-worth-income-salary-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Morgan Rose Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./shows-alex-jones-delights-with-adorable-photo-of-mini-me-daughter-ann.html>Alex Jones delights with adorable photo of mini-me daughter Annie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alexandra-silva-wiki-age-bio-height.html>Alexandra Silva Wiki (Model) Age, Bio, Height, Weight, Net worth, Ethnicity, Boyfriend, Affairs &amp;amp; Fa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./becky-g-power-rangers-actor.html>Becky G Talks Gay 'Power Rangers' Character and Immigration</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beth-behrs-net-worth.html>Beth Behrs Net Worth 2024: Income, Real Estate and Financial Success</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chaunte-wayans.html>Chaunte Wayans Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Husband, Salary and Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib.
