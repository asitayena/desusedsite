No woman should ever be restricted from making decisions about her own body. No one should EVER be held against their will … or ever have to ask permission to access everything they’ve worked so hard for.”</p><p>The Tennessee native went on to note that he and his wife, <a href=#><strong>Jessica Biel</strong></a>, were sending their “love and … absolute support” to the “Circus” singer, 39, concluding, “We hope the courts, and her family make this right and let her live however she wants to live.”</p><p>After years of silence, Spears spoke out for the first time about the conservatorship she’s been under since February 2008 in an open court hearing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Justin-Timberlake-Sends-Love-to-Ex-Britney-Spears-After-Hearing.jpg><p>“I just want my life back,” the Princess of Pop said on Wednesday. “It’s been 13 years, and it’s enough. It’s been a long time since I’ve owned my money. And it’s my wish and my dream for all of this to end without being tested. … I’m great at what I do. And I allow these people to control what I do.”</p><p>The dancer said that she wanted to “start trying to have another baby,” but her team <a href=#>wouldn’t “let” her get her IUD removed</a>. “Basically, this conservatorship is doing me way more harm than good,” Spears, who has been dating model <a href=#><strong>Sam Asghari</strong> </a>since 2016, said.</p><p>The Louisiana native added that her dad,<a href=#> <strong>Jamie Spears</strong></a>, and “anyone involved in this conservatorship and [her] management who played a key role in punishing” her should be “in jail.”</p><p>The 68-year-old’s attorney, <strong>Vivan Thoreen</strong>, read a statement on his behalf at the hearing, which read, “<a href=#>He’s sorry to see his daughter suffering</a> in so much pain.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Grammy winner was previously in a relationship with Timberlake from 1998 to 2002. Their breakup was documented in The New York Times‘ <a href=#>“Framing Britney Spears”</a> in February 2021, which took a closer look at the effects of Timberlake’s cheating accusations and the Spears look-alike he hired for his “Cry Me a River” music video. The former ‘NSync member subsequently <a href=#>apologized for how he handled their breakup</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Justin-Timberlake-Sends-Love-to-Ex-Britney-Spears-After-Hearing-2.jpg><p>“I want to take accountability for my own missteps in all of this as well as be part of a world that uplifts and supports,” the actor wrote via Instagram at the time. “I care deeply about the wellbeing of the people I love and have loved. I can do better, and I will do better.”</p><p>The Emmy winner <a href=#>married Biel in 2012</a> and <a href=#>shares two sons</a> with the actress, 39 — Silas, 6, and Phineas, who they <a href=#>secretly welcomed</a> sometime in 2020.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajraOptq9506Kkm52ioa6ssYysnKeco2K5sMLEZquoZZWteqO%2ByK2lnrFdqL2mrdGsZJqepJq%2FbrTEmqmippdk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kris-jenner-brus-jenner-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kris Jenner and Bruce Jenner Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./julien-stoermer-coleman-parents.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Julien Stoermer Coleman Parents, Net Worth, Biography, Age, Movies, &amp;amp; TV Shows</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./shows-alex-jones-delights-with-adorable-photo-of-mini-me-daughter-ann.html>Alex Jones delights with adorable photo of mini-me daughter Annie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alexandra-silva-wiki-age-bio-height.html>Alexandra Silva Wiki (Model) Age, Bio, Height, Weight, Net worth, Ethnicity, Boyfriend, Affairs &amp;amp; Fa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./becky-g-power-rangers-actor.html>Becky G Talks Gay 'Power Rangers' Character and Immigration</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beth-behrs-net-worth.html>Beth Behrs Net Worth 2024: Income, Real Estate and Financial Success</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chaunte-wayans.html>Chaunte Wayans Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Husband, Salary and Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib.
