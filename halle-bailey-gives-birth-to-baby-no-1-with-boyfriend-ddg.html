In August, Bailey wore an oversized pink set to <a href=#><strong>Beyoncé</strong></a>’s concert in Atlanta. She was also photographed walking in the background of a video posted by DDG, 26, in which she appeared to be holding a baby bump.</p><p>Bailey fueled the speculation in September when she skipped the <a href=#>red carpet at the MTV Video Music Awards</a> and wore a billowing orange dress that hid her stomach while introducing Måneskin’s performance.</p><p>Days before her VMAs appearance, Bailey spoke exclusively to Us Weekly about her wardrobe, sharing that it was “so much fun to <a href=#>explore different” styles</a> amid all the chatter surrounding her clothing choices. She revealed that her personal style is “bohemian, really chic and comfortable,” and while the ensembles she wore during <a href=#>her Little Mermaid press tour</a> were “fire,” she wanted to “switch it up a little bit and get out of the princessy looks.” As such, she hinted that fans would see her in more “baggy streetwear” for the “fall time,” noting that “most of the time [I like to] dress down.”</p><p>One day prior, Bailey opened up about embracing her evolving figure through <a href=#>her style choices</a>. “My body is changing, I’m learning who I am,” she told Cosmopolitan. “I want to be sexy. I want to feel good. I want to wear clothes that embrace where I am in life.”</p><p>Halle credited her sister, <a href=#><strong>Chloe Bailey</strong></a>, for helping her “find my footing in this whole adult-woman world,” adding that her “confidence has gotten deeper and bigger” with her older sibling’s encouragement.</p><p>As for Halle’s love life, she was first linked to DDG (real name Darryl Dwayne Granberry Jr.) in January 2022 after the pair were spotted at <a href=#><strong>Usher</strong></a>’s Las Vegas residency. Two months later, they confirmed their relationship when the rapper shared a birthday tribute to the actress on Instagram.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Halle revealed to <a href=#>Cosmopolitan</a> that her romance with DDG has inspired her musically. “All musical inspiration really just comes from life experiences,” she said. “Love has been a really big one for me too because that’s something I’m experiencing for the first time, and it’s, like, ‘whoa’ in your brain. It’s just fireworks, a spark for creativity.”</p><p>Halle went on to divulge how her dynamic with DDG differed from her past romantic encounters. “You know, you have puppy love experiences, you think that’s love,” she added. “But this is my first deep, deep, real love.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGahmZyhsm6uwKKjnrFdnLa3sdJmmaKqpJ16tbuMm5ibsV2jvG59jLCgraBdl7y6stGinKecXZmxqHs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./hill-harper-a-cancer-survivor-intends-to-wed-his-asian-girlfriend-as-his-wife.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Hill Harper, A Cancer Survivor, Intends To Wed His Asian Girlfriend As His Wife</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./fai-khadra-not-dating-kylie-jenner-relationship.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fai Khadra Is Not Dating Kylie Jenner</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./shows-alex-jones-delights-with-adorable-photo-of-mini-me-daughter-ann.html>Alex Jones delights with adorable photo of mini-me daughter Annie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alexandra-silva-wiki-age-bio-height.html>Alexandra Silva Wiki (Model) Age, Bio, Height, Weight, Net worth, Ethnicity, Boyfriend, Affairs &amp;amp; Fa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./becky-g-power-rangers-actor.html>Becky G Talks Gay 'Power Rangers' Character and Immigration</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beth-behrs-net-worth.html>Beth Behrs Net Worth 2024: Income, Real Estate and Financial Success</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chaunte-wayans.html>Chaunte Wayans Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Husband, Salary and Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib.
