Well, if you’re ready, let’s start.</p><h2>Early Life & Biography</h2><p>Michelle Knight was born on 23 April 1981 in Cleveland, Ohio. She has two siblings, Freddie Knight, and Katie Hudson. &nbsp;She came from poor family background and had to take care of her brother. &nbsp;Katie was born during the period of her disappearance. The family could not even afford a coach, let alone a stove. To make a hot meal, she would resort to using a heater just to make a hot dog.</p><p>She had a pretty rough upbringing that led her to run away from home once as a teenager. Knight slept in a garbage can wondering where her next meal would come from.&nbsp; If that was not enough, she underwent the trauma of being sexually molested and raped by a male relative when she was just a young girl.</p><p>She eventually resorted to going back home after spending a few nights out in the cold and hungry. Soon after she went back to school and before she knew it, Michelle got sexually engaged with her male classmate resulting in teenage pregnancy. She eventually had to drop out of school, especially after being mocked by her fellow students. She gave birth to a baby boy and raised him at home. Information about her parents’ names has not been disclosed.</p><h2>Personal Life</h2><p>Michelle spent most of her teenage years chained up like an animal by a psycho and sexual predator. Before that, she was raped by a male relative, something that no child should ever encounter. &nbsp;In addition to that, she had a son when she was about 12 years old by a classmate she was involved in. She struggled to raise her son, seeing her family was poor. An incident that almost tore her apart is when she lost her son to foster care. Her mother’s boyfriend injured the boy’s knee when he was drunk. Her world was slowly crumbling piece by piece.</p><p>On the day of her disappearance, she was on her way to court to fight for her son’s custody that was two years and a few months at the time. As fate would have it, the poor girl got lost on her way to court as she thought that she could have a sigh of relief when a man posing as someone who wanted to help approached her. That was the beginning of her nightmare as the man was her kidnapper, Ariel Castro, who robbed her ten years of her life.</p><p>A few years later, after trying to get over the trauma she went through, true love came her way. She met Miguel Rodriguez through a friend on Facebook. They later bumped into each other at a restaurant, and their bond was spiked. The couple later got married on May 6th, 2016.
