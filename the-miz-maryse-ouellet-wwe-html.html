And recently, things got physical between the two inside the ring.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Things got a bit heated during The Miz's altercation with Edge. And at the end of this fiasco, Miz received a slap on-air&nbsp;from his wife. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>The Miz and Edge Went at for One Another before the Pay-Per-View</h2><p>On December 13, 2021's <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">episode of WWE Raw</a>, Maryse came out to the ring to announce her husband&nbsp;The Miz's induction to the WWE Hall Of Fame. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>With this announcement, he is set to be the first inductee into the WWE Hall of Fame Class of 2022.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>At the start of&nbsp;the Miz TV episode, Maryse announced her husband,&nbsp;the father of her children, and "the most awesome human being on this planet." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Then they showed off his Hall of Fame package and proceeded to mock R-Rated Superstar Edge.</p><p>Further, he claimed that his win would cement his position as one of the greatest in WWE history.</p><p>While the celebrations continued on stage, Edge appeared from backstage.&nbsp;Miz, however, kept going with his insults. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Edge, too, hit back with strong comments. He called Miz a "showoff" and&nbsp;mocked his "me first" attitude.</p><p>Adding to this, Edge opined that while being a talented superstar, Miz lacked the right attitude, unlike himself.</p><p>Towards the end of his speech, he talked about not taking their face-off lightly and hinting at what he was planning to do to him. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>'I'm going to knock that constipated look off your face…," said Edge, while also promising to teach him a few lessons at Day 1 of Miz's pay-per-view match.</p><h2>The Miz Used Wife Maryse Ouellet as a Human Shield</h2><p>After being at the receiving end of pretty heavy disrespect, Miz was frustrated. And he took this out on Edge.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>He splashed his champagne on Edge's face. Distracted by that, Edge could not defend himself.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>He fell down but got back up just as quickly. However, he did not take time to set up his signature move, Spear.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Miz, on the other hand, wasn't well-prepared for the attack. So, he used Maryse instead.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The future Hall of Fame inductee used his wife as a human shield. This blindsided Edge, who could not get to Miz.</p><p>Hiding behind Maryse, Miz then delivered a kick to Edge's head and put the altercation to an end with his signature move, the Skull Crushing Finale. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>After finishing Edge off, Miz kissed his wife on the cheeks, caught and raised their hands,&nbsp;and began celebrating his victory.</p><p>Maryse, however, was not impressed.</p><p>She began arguing with him in the middle of the ring. Finally, after exchanging a few words, she looked like she had&nbsp;had enough of him for the time being.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>So, she slapped&nbsp;her husband right square in the face.</p><p>As for Miz, he looks perplexed at what had just happened.</p><p>The couple's show ends as she storms off backstage, clearly not happy with her husband's actions. Miz runs behind her&nbsp;requesting her not to be angry at him. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKyYmnqutdlmpJqqqaiybrvUnqOlnaRixLixjaGrpqQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./thermajane-long-johns-6979313.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>This Long John Set From Amazon Is on Sale for $30</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./63191af446163fbb3d8b45a6-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tai Emery says that flashing her boobs after her win boosted her OnlyFans subscribers 6,150%</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./shows-alex-jones-delights-with-adorable-photo-of-mini-me-daughter-ann.html>Alex Jones delights with adorable photo of mini-me daughter Annie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alexandra-silva-wiki-age-bio-height.html>Alexandra Silva Wiki (Model) Age, Bio, Height, Weight, Net worth, Ethnicity, Boyfriend, Affairs &amp;amp; Fa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./becky-g-power-rangers-actor.html>Becky G Talks Gay 'Power Rangers' Character and Immigration</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beth-behrs-net-worth.html>Beth Behrs Net Worth 2024: Income, Real Estate and Financial Success</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chaunte-wayans.html>Chaunte Wayans Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Husband, Salary and Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib.
