Complete Dating History</b></h2><p><span><strong>It seems like Brad Pitt is single</strong> and not dating anyone in a relationship. According to an insider the actor dating casually is not serious.</span></p><h3><b>Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston&nbsp;</b></h3><p><span>Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston were married from 2000 until 2005. There were rumors about their reconciliation in January 2020 as they had an adorable moment at the SAG Awards backstage. However, this just turned out to be their fans’ speculations and nothing else.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In 1998, Brad Pitt and <a href=# rel=noopener>Jennifer Aniston</a> met on a blind date arranged by their agent for the first time. They tied the knot in 2000 after dating for two years. The reason behind their divorce was Pitt’s affair with Angelina Jolie.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>Brad Pitt And Angelina Jolie</b></h3><p><span>Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie fell in love on the set of the 2005 film Mr. & Mrs. Smith and started dating. After dating for nearly a decade, the couple tied the knot with each other in 2014. The couple welcomed three kids together and also adopted another three.</span></p><p><span>Sadly, the beautiful couple also divorced in 2019. Reportedly, they officially separated in 2016.</span></p><h3><b>Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts&nbsp;</b></h3><p><span>Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts have appeared in a number of films together like Ocean’s Eleven, Ocean’s Twelve and The Mexican. The rumors of their dating started circulating since then but they have been friends only.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>Brad Pitt and Geena Davis</b></h3><p><span>There have been speculations of Brad Pitt and <a href=# rel=noopener>Geena Davis</a> romance but those were never addressed by any of them. In 1991, the two appeared in Thelma & Louise. According to a report, they kept their relationship private after Davis requested for the same. But reportedly their romance was brief.</span></p><h3><b>Brad Pitt and Gwyneth Paltrow</b></h3><p><span>Brad Pitt started dating actress Gwyneth Paltrow in 1994 and they were even engaged. Sadly, they weren’t meant to stay together forever and in 1997, they broke up. The duo continued to be amicable after their separation.</span></p><p><span>Gwyneth once said about their relationship: “​​I was such a kid, I was 22 when we met. It’s taken me until 40 to get my head out of my ass. You can’t make that decision when you’re 22 years old. I wasn’t ready, and he was too good for me.”</span></p><h3><b>Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis</b></h3><p><span>Brad Pitt dated Juliette Lewis from 1990 until 1993. The two met on the set of the television film “Too Young to Die?” In an interview with Rolling Stone, Pitt said of the relationship “We were trying to be Sid and Nancy or something. We were idiots. We were just having a great time.”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Brad-Pitt-and-Juliette-Lewis.jpg><p><span>In a 1995 interview with Vanity, he said “I still love the woman. There’s some real genius there. I had a great time with her. Look, I don’t want to go into an explanation. She has her own views, and I respected those views. She does know people. It was one of the greatest relationships I’ve ever been in. The problem is, we grow up with this vision that love conquers all, and that’s just not so, is it?”&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>Brad Pitt and Julia Ormond</b></h3><p><span>There were rumors of Brad Pitt having dated Julia Ormond but none of them ever confirmed their relationship so it is still unknown.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Apart from the relationships above, <strong>Brad Pitt had also dated other celebrities</strong>.
