On live national television, two models decided to flash the pitcher of the Astros and were subsequently <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">banned from attending all MLB events indefinitely</a>.</p><p>The models in question are <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Julia Rose</a> and Lauren Summer, who are in charge of Shagmag, a magazine that features topless photos of famous Instagram models in "a place that was fun but one that still had meaning," the website reads.</p><p>"There are all these beautiful Instagram models but who are they really?" founder Julia writes on the website's homepage. "Who are the upcoming innovators and creators, and what the actual f--k is going on in the world? So many questions and now there is an answer: SHAGMAG."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>FUCK BREAST CANCER <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/U9zy4t8RGy</a></p>â€” Kayla (@spicystepmom) <a href=#>October 28, 2019</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Julia Rose and Lauren Summer were banned for their attempt to "promote a business."</h2><p>During the fifth game of the World Series, Julia and Lauren, along with their friend Kayla Lauren had seats behind the home plate. The trio wore shirts that said "Shagmag," and when the pitcher went up to the plate Lauren and Julia flashed him.&nbsp;</p><p>The game was halted and Lauren, Julia, and Kayla were escorted out by security and then detained by police.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, a video of the incident went viral on Twitter.</p><p>Julia and Lauren later received letters <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">banning them from ever attending another MLB event</a>. The letter read "During the game, you violated the fan code of conduct by exposing yourself during the 7th inning, in order to promote a business. You were also part of a scheme in which you induced others to expose themselves to promote a business. You are hereby banned from all Major League Baseball stadiums and facilities, indefinitely."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>We already have clout, this was for breast cancer. Subscribe to <a href=#>@SHAGMAG_</a> to help us pay off womenâ€™s medical bills. ðŸ’• <a href=#>https://t.co/fb2fnMpG06</a></p>â€” Lauren Summer (@HeyLaurenSummer) <a href=#>October 28, 2019</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The girls later said it was part of a promotion for Breast Cancer Awareness.</h2><p>In a video posted to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kayla's Twitter</a> after the event, the girls claimed that the stunt was to encourage people to subscribe to Shagmag, which was donating money to Breast Cancer Awareness.</p><p>"Yo, we just flashed the whole f------g World Series game five, baby. Shagmag for life," Kayla says in the video. "F--k breast cancer. Donate to breast cancer. F--k cancer."</p><p>But fans weren't buying it. Twitter user @RydetoWin <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">replied</a> to Kayla, saying "You do you queen, but as a breast cancer survivor and a [baseball] fan letâ€™s not pretend this was a stand against a greater cause. Please just call it what it is: self promotion."</p><p>"We already have clout, this was for breast cancer," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lauren replied</a> to someone on Twitter who claimed they were just looking for "clout." "Subscribe to @SHAGMAG_to help us pay off womenâ€™s medical bills."</p><p>It has yet to be confirmed if any of the proceeds from Shagmag subscriptions are going to pay women's medical bills, as Lauren claims. Their website makes no mention of the donations, nor is there any mention of it on the website's Twitter account.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn8KttcBmqairlWK6ra6Mm5in</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kailyn-lowrys-6-16-21.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kailyn Lowry's Ex-BFF Lawyers Up To Protect Himself From Her Anger</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./josh-mcdaniels-arrested-and-charged-is-he-in-jail.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Josh Mcdaniels Arrested And Charged: Is He In Jail?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./shows-alex-jones-delights-with-adorable-photo-of-mini-me-daughter-ann.html>Alex Jones delights with adorable photo of mini-me daughter Annie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alexandra-silva-wiki-age-bio-height.html>Alexandra Silva Wiki (Model) Age, Bio, Height, Weight, Net worth, Ethnicity, Boyfriend, Affairs &amp;amp; Fa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./becky-g-power-rangers-actor.html>Becky G Talks Gay 'Power Rangers' Character and Immigration</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beth-behrs-net-worth.html>Beth Behrs Net Worth 2024: Income, Real Estate and Financial Success</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chaunte-wayans.html>Chaunte Wayans Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Husband, Salary and Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib.
