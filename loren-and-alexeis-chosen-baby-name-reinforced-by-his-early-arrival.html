In an&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IG post</a>, Loren explained her firstborn’s name Shai means “gift.”</p><p>Due to having a C-section, Asher was likely born much smaller than if he would have arrived without a C-section, and therefore completely suits the term “Baby Boten”, aka “Peanut.”</p><p>As reported by <a href=#>US Weekly</a>, the TLC stars have also shared that their second child was born on August 16th and weighs a “whopping” 5 lbs. and 7 oz. He’s 19 inches tall.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I've watched their story from the beginning…all the ups and downs.

This was dangerous for Loren, as she had a cervical cerclage a few years ago, and if the baby pushed too hard then they could break the cerclage and come out.</p><p>The doctor said that if her baby came this early, they would have to spend at least four weeks in the NICU. This scared Loren, as she said she’s “not ready for that, that’s not how it’s supposed to go.”</p><p>Despite concerns from doctors due to being premature, Asher was born healthy and there were no major complications.</p><p>Loren announced his birth on her Instagram and wrote: “Due to some circumstances, he is in the NICU, but recovering well.
