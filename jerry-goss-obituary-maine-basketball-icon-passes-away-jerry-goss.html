Jerry, the co-director of the Bangor Tournament since 2012, passed away, leaving a void that will be deeply felt by players, coaches, and fans alike.</p><p>Jerry was not just an organizer; he was a pillar of support for everyone involved in the basketball tournaments. Serving as the Maine Principal’s liaison with the Cross Insurance Center, teams, bands, and spectators, he played a pivotal role in ensuring the smooth operation of the tournaments. His dedication and calm demeanor earned him respect and admiration from all who had the privilege of working with him.</p><p>For those familiar with the High School Basketball Tournament at the old Civic Center or the Cross Insurance Center, Jerry’s presence was synonymous with the event. His legacy extended beyond his organizational duties; he was a kind and thoughtful individual who touched the lives of many. Whether orchestrating WDEA’s position or ensuring the seamless execution of the tournament, Jerry was a constant, reliable presence.</p><p>Jerry Goss’s impact goes beyond the basketball court. The City of Brewer’s website reveals a career dedicated to education, including eighteen years as a teacher and assistant principal at Joseph A. Leonard Jr. High in Old Town and fifteen years as the principal of Brewer High School. His commitment to education was mirrored in his enduring marriage to his wife Jean for fifty-two years, and together, they built a loving family with two sons, Jeff and Jon, along with their respective families.</p><p>As the Maine High School basketball season kicks off, the community mourns the loss of Jerry Goss, a true leader and friend who will be remembered for his contributions both on and off the court. His legacy of kindness, dedication, and unwavering support will continue to inspire all those who were fortunate enough to know him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidpJq%2Fr63Loaanp6Keu6h6wqikaKKVp7%2B6ecaoqqxln5e2tcHAq7BmpZGeu6Z5wZqqpJ2kl66tuIyimqimXaWutL%2FErGSar5Guequx0auwZp%2BfqMBw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jun.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jun (A.C.E) Height, Weight, Age, Body Statistics</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jeff-dye.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jeff Dye</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./shows-alex-jones-delights-with-adorable-photo-of-mini-me-daughter-ann.html>Alex Jones delights with adorable photo of mini-me daughter Annie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alexandra-silva-wiki-age-bio-height.html>Alexandra Silva Wiki (Model) Age, Bio, Height, Weight, Net worth, Ethnicity, Boyfriend, Affairs &amp;amp; Fa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./becky-g-power-rangers-actor.html>Becky G Talks Gay 'Power Rangers' Character and Immigration</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beth-behrs-net-worth.html>Beth Behrs Net Worth 2024: Income, Real Estate and Financial Success</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chaunte-wayans.html>Chaunte Wayans Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Husband, Salary and Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib.
