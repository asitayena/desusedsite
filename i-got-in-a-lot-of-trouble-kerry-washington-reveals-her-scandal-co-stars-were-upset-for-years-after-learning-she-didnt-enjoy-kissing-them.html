Life imitated art when Washington was tasked with deciding which of her two co-stars with whom she most enjoyed sharing those sultry scenes.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/atlantablackstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pjimage-34-600x338.jpg><p>While appearing on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show,” Washington reflected on the moment that had occurred on the talk show years ago.&nbsp;</p><p>“I got in a lot of trouble here because you asked who I liked to kiss better on the show between the two male leads,” said Washington to the host of 19 years. The actress’ answer, while she hoped was diplomatic, did not go over well with Goldwyn or Foley. “I said, I thought I was keeping the peace by saying, ‘I don’t like kissing either one of them.’ ”</p><p>She added, “But they were both pretty pi–ed for years. ‘Like why would you say that on national television.’ ”&nbsp;</p><p>The talk show host then suggested that kissing both men could have been equally enjoyable. “Who says that?” Washington coyly asked. “Nobody telling the truth,” quipped DeGeneres as both women chuckled.&nbsp;</p><p>The show created by Shonda Rhimes was the anchor to ABC’s Thursday lineup that would ultimately feature three full hours of Rhimes’ content — “Grey’s Anatomy,” “How to Get Away With Murder” and “Scandal.”</p><p>Casting Washington as the lead made history; the Bronx native was the first Black woman to lead a network drama in over three decades.&nbsp;</p><p>“I didn’t feel the pressure from my ego, like ‘I <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">have</a> to make the show work,’ ” Washington told Variety in 2020. “It was more ‘If we f—k this up, it’s going to be another 40 years before they let a Black woman be the lead of a network drama. We have to get this right.’ ”</p><p>Washington’s work on the hit drama would earn her three Emmy nods, though she would not win until 2020, for her works as an executive producer on HBO’s “Little Fires Everywhere.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX9ze49uZmtpX556qLvTZqCnZZFiubDAjKidZqyipMKjuMRmop6qoq56uK3SoaCnn6Sku26%2BxK%2BcmqSjYrWmvoysmpqmlJa5bq%2FOZqqtmaKoerix0Z5krqijmsFuss6rZLKdkafAbq3FrZyrZZyarrO6yKeeZquYmnqltcOnq2adnp%2B8unnKoqqsoZ6cerW0xKZm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./in-the-past-three-years-jeffrey-epstein-has-doubled-his-property-holdings-including-buying-a-second-caribbean-island-for-18-million.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>In The Past Three Years Jeffrey Epstein Has Doubled His Property Holdings, Including Buying A Second</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1318129-haley-joel-osment-bio-age-height-net-worth-family-movies-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Haley Joel Osment bio: age, height, net worth, family, movies</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./shows-alex-jones-delights-with-adorable-photo-of-mini-me-daughter-ann.html>Alex Jones delights with adorable photo of mini-me daughter Annie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alexandra-silva-wiki-age-bio-height.html>Alexandra Silva Wiki (Model) Age, Bio, Height, Weight, Net worth, Ethnicity, Boyfriend, Affairs &amp;amp; Fa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./becky-g-power-rangers-actor.html>Becky G Talks Gay 'Power Rangers' Character and Immigration</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beth-behrs-net-worth.html>Beth Behrs Net Worth 2024: Income, Real Estate and Financial Success</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chaunte-wayans.html>Chaunte Wayans Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Husband, Salary and Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib.
