Many people mistake Love for Crush and vice versa and some use these terms interchangeably to show their affection and care for others. However, Crush and Love are two related but distinct terms having spring differences amongst them.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=crush-vs-love></span><strong>Crush vs Love</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>The main difference between Crush and Love is that Crush is a temporary outwardly feeling which lasts for a short time, while Love is a deep intense feeling enduring for a lifetime.</strong></p><p>However, the above is not the only difference. A comparison between both the terms on certain parameters can shed light on subtle aspects:</p><span>&nbsp;</span><h2 class=question><span class=ez-toc-section id=comparison-table-between-crush-and-love-in-tabular-form></span>Comparison Table Between Crush and Love (in Tabular Form)<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><span>&nbsp;</span><h2 class=question><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-crush></span>What is Crush?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Crush is a temporary yet strong feeling of liking someone. Crush means a feeling of romantic love for someone. This someone is always a human being and a person of the opposite sex with some dynamic physical characteristics or special skills. Crush can and usually happens with someone whom one doesn’t know well.</p><p>Crush develops very quickly on seeing the other person and the outward appearance of another person makes a strong impact. Crush can signal a burning desire to be with that attractive person. Also, Crush wears out easily as soon as the desire is fulfilled or the other person loses the attractive special attributes or is replaced by another person having better ones.</p><p>Crush may have happened with almost everyone in their life. For example, someone may have had a Crush on a beautiful girl in the college or a new handsome professor who had recently joined the campus. Crush is mostly a feeling associated with people in their early teenage days.</p><p>Crush does not involve any sacrifice, forgiveness, caring, or other emotions. The one and the only thing in focus is the charming and attractive personality of another person. Crush can lead to a wrong state of affairs especially if one of the persons has any sinister tendencies.&nbsp;</p><span>&nbsp;</span><h2 class=question><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-love></span>What is Love?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Love means an intense feeling of deep affection. This fondness or care or compassion can be with anyone. Love can be with a newborn, parents or spouses, or animals or in any interest.</p><p>Love can also be called as an emotion. This happens when a person has strong feelings of tenderness or care for another person. Love does not see a state of perfection in others, rather it accepts others the way they are, whether good or bad, whether handsome, beautiful, or ugly.&nbsp;</p><p>Love is not something that can happen overnight. Love usually develops with interactions built over after getting acquainted with someone. Love slowly evolves into an intensive deep soulful relationship. Love is like a seed sown which matures into a flower after a certain period.&nbsp;</p><p>Love is unconditional. Love does not expect any return or favor or even Love from another person. Love only expects the other person to be happy and makes an effort in this pursuit to bring joy and happiness to the doors of the Loved ones.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center id=0--main-differences-between-career-and-goal-><span class=ez-toc-section id=main-differences-between-crush-and-love></span><strong>Main Differences Between Crush and Love</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><li>Crush is a short-term phenomenon and can come and go any time. Love is a long-term state which binds people together for a lifetime.</li><li>Crush does not involve patience, forgiveness, or understanding of another person. Loves denote a sense of caring, understanding, and forgiveness.</li><li>Crush can be replaced with lust or other vices. Love stays intact as a Love without any evils.</li><li>Crush happens looking at the attractive sensual characteristics of another person. Love does not look at physical features, it doesn’t matter whether the person is good looking or ugly.</li><li>Crush is more of an infatuation. Love is a deep intense feeling touching the heart.</li><li>Crush can be with only a human being and that too a person of the opposite sex. Love is a feeling of affection and trust with a human being, God, parents, children, animals, objects, or any specific interests.&nbsp;</li><span>&nbsp;</span><h2 class=question><span class=ez-toc-section id=conclusion></span>Conclusion<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In a real-world scenario, Crush and Love go hand in hand with Love ultimately replacing Crush if all things go well. A person may have experienced Crush and Love at all stages in his/her life. As a small adolescent, there was more of a Crush which remained in the late 20s or even 30s.</p><p>However, as the person becomes matured the real understanding of Love and for that matter the difference between Crush and Love is realized. This experience eventually paves the way for Love to reach someone’s heart so deeply binding the Loved souls forever for a lifetime.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=references></span>References<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><li>https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/sbp/sbp/2004/00000032/00000002/art00007</li><li>https://dc.swosu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2878&context=westview</li><li>https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=6368964</li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDx5qrZqGjZMSprdNmoKxlpJ2ybrDIn52eqpWjsKZ5wZ6rsJ2Vo3qkvtSsn2aZnpl6rbvVnmY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tommy-ryman-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What is Tommy Ryman Net Worth 2024: Wiki, Real Name, Age, Height, Family</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./les-nouvelles-polyphonies-corses-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What is Les Nouvelles Polyphonies Corses Net Worth 2024: Wiki, Real Name, Age, Height, Family</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./shows-alex-jones-delights-with-adorable-photo-of-mini-me-daughter-ann.html>Alex Jones delights with adorable photo of mini-me daughter Annie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alexandra-silva-wiki-age-bio-height.html>Alexandra Silva Wiki (Model) Age, Bio, Height, Weight, Net worth, Ethnicity, Boyfriend, Affairs &amp;amp; Fa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./becky-g-power-rangers-actor.html>Becky G Talks Gay 'Power Rangers' Character and Immigration</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beth-behrs-net-worth.html>Beth Behrs Net Worth 2024: Income, Real Estate and Financial Success</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chaunte-wayans.html>Chaunte Wayans Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Husband, Salary and Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib.
