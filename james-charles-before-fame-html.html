With his&nbsp;strong media following, he has&nbsp;established himself as one of the most vital voices of&nbsp;a new generation of male beauty vloggers.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>But&nbsp;Charles had a humble beginning and tried many things on platforms like YouTube before fame. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>James Charles' Early Life</h2><p>The famed make-up artist was born&nbsp;James Charles Dickinson and brought up in Bethlehem, New York. He grew a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">liking for make-up</a> and&nbsp;grooming&nbsp;from an early age (before he was gay, or atleast before he came out), which ended up being his career, too. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>Before I did make-up, I did hair. For one of my best friends, I did her hair for a military ball at a local school, and she was an hour late for her make-up appointment at a local counter, and she asked me to do her make-up.</p><p>When he was in his teen years, Charles&nbsp;even persuaded his father, an events contractor by profession,&nbsp;to change the family basement into a make-up studio.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>He then started charging&nbsp;his friends around $5 a time to do their make-ups, and eventually, he posted his works on social media, helping him gain recognition from a broader audience. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>James Charles Came Out at the Age of 12</h2><p>Charles, 22, was 12-year-old when he realized that he was gay. Speaking of his sexuality publicly he said,</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>I had just gone through puberty, and like every other boy, I was going through that stage of life. Clearly, at this point, in my own head, I had figured out that I was not exactly interested in the sisters, and I was definitely down for the brothers.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>But he didn't share his&nbsp;realization with his parents, as they learned of his sexuality after delving into his internet browsing history.&nbsp;That said, his parents were "incredibly accepting" of his identity.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>In a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">collaborative video</a> with&nbsp;Jeff Wittek in&nbsp;April 2019,&nbsp;Charles also revealed that he had dated gay men, as well as trans guys, in the past. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>James Charles Previously Made ‘Comedy’ Videos on YouTube</h2><p>As stated earlier, the make-up guru previously made videos for YouTube, but they were not related to beauty or make-up.</p><p>Charles apparently managed a channel titled&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">JaysCoding</a>, where he posted random videos. The channel's last upload was on January 2, 2012, and it has over 124,000 subscribers at present.&nbsp;He also posted comedy videos on his&nbsp;current YouTube channel.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>In May 2018, he reacted to his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">old YouTube videos</a> on his current YouTube channel. In one of his videos, apparently his intro video, he sat down with his mother and announced that he had crossed 100 subscribers. His other old YouTube video saw him doing a comedy skit, where he sold a glass of lemonade for 50 cents. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Charles enjoyed watching most of his videos but implied that he would not make such videos in the coming days.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKKRorK0ecKhmKuklah6o7HFqKmeZZaWuqZ6x62kpQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jennifer-love-hewitt-nose-plastic-surgery-rumors.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jennifer Love Hewitt Nose: Plastic Surgery Rumors</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jada-crawley-bio-kids-family-facts-about-chris-paul-wife.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jada Crawley Bio, Kids, Family, Facts About Chris Paul Wife</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./shows-alex-jones-delights-with-adorable-photo-of-mini-me-daughter-ann.html>Alex Jones delights with adorable photo of mini-me daughter Annie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alexandra-silva-wiki-age-bio-height.html>Alexandra Silva Wiki (Model) Age, Bio, Height, Weight, Net worth, Ethnicity, Boyfriend, Affairs &amp;amp; Fa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./becky-g-power-rangers-actor.html>Becky G Talks Gay 'Power Rangers' Character and Immigration</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beth-behrs-net-worth.html>Beth Behrs Net Worth 2024: Income, Real Estate and Financial Success</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chaunte-wayans.html>Chaunte Wayans Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Husband, Salary and Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib.
