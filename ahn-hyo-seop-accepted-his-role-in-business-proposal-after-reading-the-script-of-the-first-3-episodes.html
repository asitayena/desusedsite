Ahn Hyo-seop, the current hottie in the K-drama industry, said that he accepted the part in Business Proposal after just reading three episodes of the screenplay. The actor claimed that he didn’t need much persuasion to accept the part of the hardworking, kind CEO Kang Tae-moo in the romcom.</p><p>The interviewer congratulated the actor on the show’s success, telling him that it definitely demonstrated his lead power. The actor responded by saying:</p><p>“I appreciate your affection so much.” The choice to participate was likewise straightforward. The writing was entertaining. I got up to episode 3 and phoned straight away.”</p><p>He was quite enthusiastic about the performance. So much so that he didn’t give it a second thought about whether or not the program would be successful, but instead embraced it since it was entertaining.</p><p>“I didn’t even consider whether or not it would work out. I worked easily since I was convinced it would be enjoyable, and all of the other performers and crew members were as well.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Ahn-Hyo-Seop-3.jpg alt="Ahn Hyo Seop" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Ahn Hyo-seop discusses working with Kim Se-Jeong on a business proposal and Kang Tae-moo.</h2><p>27-year-old Ahn Hyo-seop has produced a number of hit dramas. He demonstrated his acting abilities in Dr. Romantic 2, Abyss, and Lovers of the Red Sky. However, the live-adaptation of the rom-com webtoon Business Proposal catapulted him to popularity. His portrayal of Kang Tae-moo, the youthful, kind-hearted, and witty CEO, drew a lot of attention.&nbsp;The interviewer informed Ahn Hyo-seop that he reminded him of Kang Tae-moo during the Q&A with Esquire Korea. In response, he said,</p><p>“I believe it was for this reason that I received praise on how at ease I seemed while playing him, albeit there were several lines that made me grimace owing to the drama’s nature.” Overall, I felt at ease speaking those lines since our (the character’s and my) emotional pathways were parallel.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Ahn-Hyo-Seop-2.jpg alt="Ahn Hyo Seop" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Business Proposal was a hit because of Ahn Hyo-seop and the equally excellent Kim Se-Jeong, whose naturally hilarious performance made people chuckle. Ahn Hyo-seop had this to say about the actress’s enthusiasm on set:</p><p>“I’m not the sort to talk first if no one forces me to.” But, owing to the pleasant mood established by Kim Se-Jeong and the whole team, I had a great day.”</p><p>He continued to compliment her, saying:</p><p>“She’s (Kim Se-Jeong) thoughtful and caring.” “I wish her success as an actor and as a person.”</p><p>Business Proposal ended a few months ago in April, but fans’ affection for the tale and Ahn Hyo-seop lives on. The actor will next be seen in the Korean version of the popular Taiwanese drama Someday or One Day, with Vincenzo leading Jeon Yeo-been.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiYoaZdncawedKepqllkZiwprzTnptmoJmoerO7y55koqZdl8K0tc2eqqxloKe8sbvSmqNmmZapsrN50Z6YnaGenHq1tMRmqpyqmaXBbrvFZquhnV2btrO%2F02ZqZp2gnsCwsMSsZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./aleksandra-klitschko-model-where-is-wladimir-klitschko-ex-wife-now-246970-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Aleksandra Klitschko Model, Where Is Wladimir Klitschko Ex Wife Now?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bottoms-everything-to-know-about-the-queer-comedy-movie.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'Bottoms': Everything to Know About the Queer Comedy Movie</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./shows-alex-jones-delights-with-adorable-photo-of-mini-me-daughter-ann.html>Alex Jones delights with adorable photo of mini-me daughter Annie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alexandra-silva-wiki-age-bio-height.html>Alexandra Silva Wiki (Model) Age, Bio, Height, Weight, Net worth, Ethnicity, Boyfriend, Affairs &amp;amp; Fa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./becky-g-power-rangers-actor.html>Becky G Talks Gay 'Power Rangers' Character and Immigration</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beth-behrs-net-worth.html>Beth Behrs Net Worth 2024: Income, Real Estate and Financial Success</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chaunte-wayans.html>Chaunte Wayans Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Husband, Salary and Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib.
