At the start of the sketch, Davidson, 29, asks the three comedians if they want to shoot a music video with him. They excitedly agree, only to discover that the song lyrics are at their expense, labeling them “three sad virgins.”</p><p>Fans were delighted by Swift’s surprise cameo in the video, in which she performs the bridge.</p><p>“We didn’t think that she would do it,” Higgins, 27, told <a href=#><strong>Jimmy Fallon</strong></a> on Monday. “We pitched it to her and we were like, ‘It’s called ‘Three Sad Virgins,’ it’s you and Pete making fun of us.’ And she was immediately like, ‘Yes.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Please-Dont-Destroy-Says-Taylor-Swift-Was-Immediately-On-Board-3.jpg><p>He added, “Now every time we’re on the street it’s like, ‘Hey, sad virgin!’”</p><p>It’s not surprising that Swift was on board with the sketch idea given her lengthy history with SNL over the years. During a recent interview on <a href=#><strong>Howard Stern</strong></a>’s <a href=#>SiriusXM radio show</a>, late-night host and SNL alum <a href=#><strong>Seth Meyers</strong></a> spoke highly of the <a href=#>singer’s 2009 hosting debut</a>, saying that her original monologue song “really speaks to what a force of nature she is and the depths of her talent.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Please-Dont-Destroy-Says-Taylor-Swift-Was-Immediately-On-Board-4.jpg><p>Meyers recalled Swift pitching her monologue to him and SNL producer <a href=#><strong>Lorne Michaels</strong></a>. “She sings this song which is not only a beautiful song by a beautiful singer,” he said. “It’s a perfect SNL monologue, fully formed. And it was, to this day, I’ve sort of never had a moment like that where someone brings you a fully gift-wrapped present and it’s exactly what you needed it to be.”</p><p>Swift has since graced the SNL stage several more times, both in sketch cameos and as the musical guest. In October, she and Kansas City Chiefs tight end <a href=#><strong>Travis Kelce</strong></a> made separate surprise appearances during the season 49 premiere amid their budding romance. Swift introduced her friend (and “Karma” collaborator) <a href=#><strong>Ice Spice</strong></a>’s musical performance, while Kelce acted in a sketch inspired by the NFL frenzy surrounding his relationship with Swift.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>After the show, the couple were spotted holding hands on a date night in New York City. The pair, who have been linked since September, are <a href=#>“really happy” together</a>, a source exclusively told Us Weekly last month.</p><p>“Travis is someone who is so different for [Taylor],” the insider added. “With him it’s easy. She doesn’t have to worry about anything.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuasZykv26%2F1qKdrWWZorqmsMiaq56kqWK5qrfEnWStoKKasm6%2FwJ1kr6GinLavv4ysop6sk516sLqMrKWlZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./most-expensive-home-for-sale-in-nashville-costs.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>This Is How Much The Most Expensive Home For Sale In Nashville Costs</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./taryn-manning-video.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Taryn Manning video Sorry for Exposing Alleged Affair with Married Man in Social Media Clip</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./shows-alex-jones-delights-with-adorable-photo-of-mini-me-daughter-ann.html>Alex Jones delights with adorable photo of mini-me daughter Annie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alexandra-silva-wiki-age-bio-height.html>Alexandra Silva Wiki (Model) Age, Bio, Height, Weight, Net worth, Ethnicity, Boyfriend, Affairs &amp;amp; Fa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./becky-g-power-rangers-actor.html>Becky G Talks Gay 'Power Rangers' Character and Immigration</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beth-behrs-net-worth.html>Beth Behrs Net Worth 2024: Income, Real Estate and Financial Success</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chaunte-wayans.html>Chaunte Wayans Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Husband, Salary and Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib.
