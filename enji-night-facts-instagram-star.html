Her father is half German and half Hungarian while her mother is half Russian and half Mongolian. However, she has black siblings from her father’s side.</p><p>The 32 year old lady grew up in both Russia and Hungary. She spent her early years with her grandfather in Russia before going back to Hungary to begin elementary school. As a result, she learned how to speak Russian early on, but she started to forget it slowly since she had abandoned it and was now speaking Hungarian.</p><p>The model has chosen to reveal this much about her childhood while she has kept further details about her family and personal life private. The names of her parents and siblings (if any) are not known. She has also mentioned that she was lonely and shy as a kid and her mum made her wear her hair short until she turned thirteen. This made many people, even her neighbors, think that she was a boy.</p><p>Regarding her educational journey, Anna has not revealed the schools she attended from high school to college. Perhaps, she has chosen to focus more on her modeling and Cosplaying career.</p><h2><strong>The Hungarian Busojaras Festival Spurred Enji Night’s Interest in Costume Designing</strong></h2><p>Some people know, or at least have an idea of what they would love to be in the future as kids, while others figure things out along the way. Enji Night belongs to the former group. She developed an interest in her current profession at an early age and her journey through the industry has been an interesting one.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, Anna picked interest in fashion and costumes from a young age. Her interest was fueled by the traditions of her home country, Hungary which holds an elaborate festival for costume display.</p><p>In Hungary, especially Mohac town, the people have a long-standing traditional festival called “Busojaras” or “The Hungarian Festival That Scares Winter Away”. During the festival, people dress in different scary costumes which they believe will scare away winter and welcome spring and its good spirits. The festival always lasts for six days, and in recent times, the locals practice it every last week of February.</p><p>Aside from the tradition of her people, another thing that greatly influenced her career choice was her love for animation series. <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Enji revealed in an interview</a> that she started watching a lot of anime at age 13. Her new hobby soon developed into a love for manga, and online gaming. Over time, she fell in love with the anime characters and the way they dressed and she wanted to look like them.</p><h3><strong>She Leveraged on Social Media To Start a Career as a Cosplayer</strong></h3><p>Although the Instagram star has always had a thing for cosplay, she started her career with costume design, something she has always had a passion for as well. She then tailored her passion to fit in with her love for cosplay. According to her, she also considered her passion for costume design when she was deciding on the college to attend.</p><p>Anna Redei nursed her passion for a long time until she decided to take advantage of social media. She started on Instagram as a fashion model. She regularly uploaded irresistible lifestyle photos and videos. Gradually, she started to garner followers on the platform. Who wouldn’t want to see more attractive photos and videos of a pretty lady with a perfect hourglass shape?</p><p>Soon, Night introduced her cosplay lifestyle to her Instagram page and launched her career fully. As you may have expected, her rising fan base grew even faster and she started to receive more attention across the globe. In less than no time, she was traveling to different places, including Tunisia and the Philippines for cosplay photoshoots, events, and activities.</p><h4><strong>As a Cosplayer, Enji Has Mimicked Several Characters Including;</strong></h4><ul><li>Supergirl</li><li>Saura Kasugano</li><li>Sailor Venus</li><li>Power Girl</li><li>Android 18</li><li>Nidalee</li><li>Nami</li><li>Ms. Marvel</li><li>Kasumi</li><li>Jill Valentine</li><li>Harley Quinn</li><li>Alice Liddell</li><li>2B</li><li>Athena</li><li>Elastic girl, etc.</li></ul><p>She does not narrow her cosplay to anime characters only. She also tries out movies and game characters. For Enji Night, the idea is to explore and try out everything and any cosplay she thinks will look good on her.</p><p>As a model, the Hungarian lady has gotten the attention of different brands, including makeup, fashion, and sports brands and they have contracted her to model for them. In recent times, she turned out to enjoy modeling more and has been doing more of it. However, she made a post on Instagram to reassure her concerned fans that she has not left cosplay, and will be doing more photoshoots soon.</p><h2><strong>Other Avenues Through Which Enji Night Makes a Living</strong></h2><h3><strong>1. Brand Influencer</strong></h3><p>It is only expected that with so much popularity and followers on social media, Anna will have brands reaching out to her to help them endorse their products. One of such brands is <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>a chair company she once advertised for</a>. She is said to charge between $2,499 to $4,165 for brand influence.</p><h3><strong>2. Costume Designer</strong></h3><p>As mentioned earlier in this article, the supermodel has always had a passion for costume designing since a young age. She continued to study around this field and has grown into a professional designer. She admits that all the costumes she uses for her cosplay are made by her. Considering how detailed her costumes are, one can tell that she is good at what she does.</p><h3><strong>3. YouTuber</strong></h3><p>After making a name for herself on Instagram as a cosplayer, Night decided to extend her tentacles to YouTube. She launched her channel “Enji Night” on June 6th, 2011, and in her first video, she shared her “Resident Evil” photoshoot. She used to share different tips and tricks for cosplayers on her channel, but she stopped posting about a year ago and her last video was a tutorial showing makeup tips and tricks for cosplayers.</p><h3><strong>4. Gamer</strong></h3><p>In addition to all the costume making, cosplaying, and modeling, Enji is also a gamer. She started playing video games much later that she got interested in other things because she came from a background that did not believe in technology. She was rather forced to go and play with plants and wildlife in the bush.</p><p>Nonetheless, she started playing video games and her first game was “Ragnarok Online”. She was addicted to it for a long time before moving on to “Wow”. She has since continued to move from one game to another, with each one of them stealing her heart for different reasons.</p><p>Aside from playing the games, the cosplayer also replicates some of the games’ characters. Some of the characters she has replicated from her favorite games are:</p><ul><li>Lara Croft from Tomb Raider</li><li>2B from Nier Automata</li><li>Jill Valentine from Resident Evil, etc.</li></ul><p>Her enthusiasm about gaming and game characters caused the “Lion Castle Entertainment” and “Triangle Studios” to reach out to her to discuss if she would love to be one of their game characters. Of course, she signed the contract with them. In the game, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>“Slide Stars”,</a>&nbsp; players are made to choose one out of over twenty internet celebrities. Their chosen celebrity will then move through some challenging water slides and they are to dodge obstacles as they slide through.</p><h3><strong>5. Enji Night’s Commanding Social Media Presence</strong></h3><p>By now, you may have guessed that Enji has to be very active on social media for her to get the best out of her career. Her profession requires her to continuously put out content to keep her audience glued to her page. She posts her pictures and videos across all her social media accounts. If she stays away for too long from social media for unavoidable reasons, she always makes sure that she tenders some form of explanation to her fans.</p><p>Her hard work appears to be paying off as her Instagram page with 801 posts (at the time of writing this article) has 1 million followers with tens of thousands of engagements per post. She is also active on Twitter with 201 thousand followers. Most of her tweets are often accompanied by pictures which are to be expected. Her Facebook page is not left out as she frequently makes posts there too. She has 588 thousand Facebook followers.</p><p>Although she is active on most of her social media pages, Night seems to have given up on her YouTube channel. The channel has 59.2 thousand subscribers and 9 videos and the last time she uploaded a video was one year ago. Perhaps she&nbsp;struggles with posting on her YouTube channel because the content she puts out there is different from what posts on her other social media accounts. Thus, she could not attain as much fame on YouTube as she has on Instagram. Apparently, she does not come close as one of the <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>richest YouTubers</a>.</p><p>It is not just because she is one of the most popular and hottest cosplayers in the industry, but Enji Night takes her time to come up with outstanding content for her fans. The Hungarian model aims to do things differently from everyone else by going the extra mile and trying out different characters across anime, games, and movies. Aside from her commitment to her job, she is also very professional and personable.</p><h2><strong>How Tall Is Enji Night?</strong></h2><p>Although Enji looks very tall from her photoshoots – probably due to the angles – she actually stands 5 feet 7 inches tall when she is not wearing heels, which is tall enough for a lady by the way.</p><p>However, as a model, Anna is a bit shorter than the required height which is 5 feet 9 inches to 10 feet. Nonetheless, she has a perfect body shape that matches her height, giving her just the right physique for a model.</p><h3><strong>Enji Night’s Height Compared to Other Cosplayers</strong></h3><p>When compared to her fellow models and cosplayers, Enji seems to have just the right height. She is often neither too tall nor too short when standing next to them. However, it is difficult to know the exact height of some of her colleagues as compared to her because they are often dressed in costumes and maybe wearing heels of different heights when taking the photos. Nonetheless, here are some of her colleagues and how their heights compare to hers.</p><h4><strong>Enji Night’s Height Vs Mikomihokina’s Height</strong></h4><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Mikomihokina </a>is a model and cosplayer with whom Enji did a collaboration for a workout photoshoot. Their posture in the picture makes it hard to tell how they compare to each other in height, but sources say that Mikomihokina is 5 feet 7 inches tall which makes her the same height as Enji.</p><h4><strong>Enji Night’s Height Compared to Lie_Chie’s Height</strong></h4><p>Lie_Chie is Night’s friend and cosplayer from Berlin. While she may not be as popular, she also has an active <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Instagram page</a>. She appears to be about the same height as Anna, but their posture makes it hard to tell. There is no official record of Lie’s height.</p><h4><strong>Palma is a Bit Taller Than Enji Night</strong></h4><p>Palma, who goes by the pseudonym <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Palmacosplay</a> on Instagram, is another model and cosplayer with whom Anna has a close relationship. Palma may be a bit taller than Anna in reality since they are almost of equal height in this photo and Anna is putting on heels while Palma is wearing a flat shoe.</p><h3><strong>Enji Night’s Weight and Body Measurement Compliment Her Height</strong></h3><p>The model’s weight is 58 kg or 127 lbs while her body measurements are unknown for now. However, Enji has a well-sculpted body shape that has caused a lot of people to think that she went under the knife to attain such a perfect figure.</p><p>She however dismissed the rumor in a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Facebook post</a>, stating that she has never had any form of plastic surgery but inherited her physique from her mother’s gene. Her mother and grandmother also have such perfect shape. Enji further revealed that she is committed to her workout session and healthy diet which helps her to maintain the hourglass shape that she has naturally.</p><h2><strong>Who is Enji Night’s Boyfriend?</strong></h2><p>Currently, Enji Night has not revealed whether or not she is dating anyone. But she was once rumored to be in a relationship with Trevor James, her fellow model, and cosplayer. This news was mere speculation and there is no confirmation whether or not it is true.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZ60qcDLoqWeZpOkunCxzaOgZqaZnLW1ecWamq2rXZ67tMDAoKmapV2owaK%2Bjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./hayao-miyazaki-net-worth-2020-2021.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Hayao Miyazaki Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./elizabeth-hurley-nearly-bares-all-shower-video.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Elizabeth Hurley nearly bares all in steamy shower video</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./shows-alex-jones-delights-with-adorable-photo-of-mini-me-daughter-ann.html>Alex Jones delights with adorable photo of mini-me daughter Annie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alexandra-silva-wiki-age-bio-height.html>Alexandra Silva Wiki (Model) Age, Bio, Height, Weight, Net worth, Ethnicity, Boyfriend, Affairs &amp;amp; Fa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./becky-g-power-rangers-actor.html>Becky G Talks Gay 'Power Rangers' Character and Immigration</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beth-behrs-net-worth.html>Beth Behrs Net Worth 2024: Income, Real Estate and Financial Success</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chaunte-wayans.html>Chaunte Wayans Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Husband, Salary and Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib.
