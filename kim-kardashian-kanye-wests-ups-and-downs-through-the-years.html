The duo reconnected years later after her <a href=#>72-day marriage</a> to <a href=#><strong>Kris Humphries</strong></a> ended. At the time, Kardashian visited Paris to attend West’s fashion show.</p><p>“Right before I got married to Kris Humphries, [Kanye and I] were talking and I just went a different direction. I think I had to go through that to figure out what I wanted,” she explained on the <a href=#>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</a> 10th anniversary special in 2017. “After my breakup, I was feeling really low and down and he said, ‘Just come to Paris and see my fashion show.’”</p><p>The businesswoman added, “He jokes that he put on this whole fashion show just to get a date with me. So, I went there and I stayed with him, and that’s where we started dating. I swear from the moment I landed, I fell madly in love with him and I thought, ‘Oh, my God. Why didn’t I do this sooner?’ Like, this is what real life is like — love and fun and real support.”</p><p>The twosome began dating in the spring of 2012 and Us Weekly confirmed that December that Kardashian was expecting the pair’s first child, <a href=#>North</a>. Four months <a href=#>after welcoming North</a>, the “Gold Digger” rapper proposed to Kardashian. The couple wed in Italy in May 2014.</p><p>As their marriage progressed, the pair <a href=#>encountered issues when trying to grow their family</a>. Though Kardashian gave birth to son <a href=#>Saint</a> in 2015, she would welcome daughter <a href=#>Chicago</a> in 2018 and son <a href=#>Psalm</a> in 2019 via surrogate.</p><p>“You get your surrogate attorney, you get your surrogate broker and then the broker recommended that we use a therapist that would communicate with me first and then communicate with her and kind of be our liaison,” she explained on <strong>Laura Wasser</strong>’s <a href=#>“All’s Fair” podcast</a> in February 2020. “Toward the end, we got close enough where we could communicate really without that.”</p><p>The pair continued to encounter and overcome hardships over the years, including <a href=#>Kardashian being held at gunpoint in her Paris hotel room in 2016</a>. West abruptly ended his New York concert and rushed to his wife’s side upon hearing of the scary incident.</p><p>In July 2020, the Grammy winner <a href=#>announced his run for the U.S. presidency</a>. During <a href=#>his campaign rally in South Carolina</a>, he revealed a very personal tidbit about <a href=#>how he and Kardashian considered aborting their daughter North</a>. He then proceeded to go on a Twitter rant, during which he claimed that <a href=#>Kardashian tried to get a “doctor to lock me up”</a> after his behavior at the South Carolina event.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>After months of split rumors, <a href=#>Kardashian filed for divorce from West</a> in February 2021.</p><p>Scroll down to see Kardashian and West’s ups and downs through the years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuKq5jKSYq5yRqLWqrc1mopqmqZp6uLHSrapmraCoeqK6w2abqK%2BeqHq1tNGorKCgXam1pnnYnpirq18%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./larry-holmes-age-wikipedia-biography-children-salary-net-worth-parents.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Larry Holmes Age, Wikipedia, Biography, Children, Salary, Net Worth, Parents.</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kim-and-kyle-richards-reunite-spend-quality-time-together-photo-2015209.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kim and Kyle Richards Reunite, Spend &amp;quot;Quality Time&amp;quot; Together: Photo</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./shows-alex-jones-delights-with-adorable-photo-of-mini-me-daughter-ann.html>Alex Jones delights with adorable photo of mini-me daughter Annie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alexandra-silva-wiki-age-bio-height.html>Alexandra Silva Wiki (Model) Age, Bio, Height, Weight, Net worth, Ethnicity, Boyfriend, Affairs &amp;amp; Fa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./becky-g-power-rangers-actor.html>Becky G Talks Gay 'Power Rangers' Character and Immigration</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beth-behrs-net-worth.html>Beth Behrs Net Worth 2024: Income, Real Estate and Financial Success</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chaunte-wayans.html>Chaunte Wayans Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Husband, Salary and Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib.
