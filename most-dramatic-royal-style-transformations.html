At university, the History of Art student was the It-girl of St Andrews, rocking low-slung jeans, spaghetti strap tops and glitzy clubbing outfits.&nbsp;</p><p>In a major departure from her 2000s wardrobe, the Princess of Wales is now an emblem of royal style perfection. With her unrivalled elegance and polished power dressing, the Princess rarely steps a foot out of line when it comes to fashion, sticking to the same silhouettes and fail-proof outfits.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>SEE: </strong><a href=#><strong>Princess Kate's cool-girl university outfits that turned Prince William's head</strong></a></p><p>She often favours designs that ooze femininity and quiet luxury, continually reigning supreme as one of the best-dressed royal ladies.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/aff6f11e4f09-sophie-edinburgh-style-transformation.jpg><h2 class="GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g hm-heading">Duchess of Edinburgh</h2><p dir=ltr>Before she became the Duchess of Edinburgh, Sophie Rhys-Jones was a PR executive who had landed a job at Capital Radio, going on to set up her own successful PR business by 31.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>Duchess Sophie's timeless fashion from the nineties proves she was an unmistakably elegant style figure of her time. From tailored mini skirts to head-turning trouser suits, the bright-blonde PR girl donned the boldest business-babe fashion looks.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>Since becoming a loyal member of the Royal Family, Duchess Sophie's sartorial elegance is unmatched. With a penchant for pastels, feminine silhouettes and marvellous millinery, the mother-of-two has never lost her eye for a polished look.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/03ba16e00955-queen-camilla-style-transformation.jpg><h2 class="GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g hm-heading">Queen Camilla</h2><p dir=ltr>Before the days of her <a href=#>bespoke Dior dresses</a> and long-lasting relationship with <a href=#>British designer Bruce Oldfield</a>, Camilla, née Shand, was just like any Londoner in her twenties - experimenting with bold colours and flirting with fit-and-flare silhouettes.</p><p dir=ltr>Now, as matriarch of the royal family, the wife of King Charles' style is as superior as her royal title. The Queen tends to favour muted colours, often opting for rich velvet fabrics and navy hues for official engagements, though in her jewels and millinery, Her Majesty isn't afraid to go bold.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6a395c7ff036-princess-beatrice-style-revolution.jpg><h2 class="GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g hm-heading">Princess Beatrice</h2><p dir=ltr>During her teens and early twenties, Princess Beatrice very much tapped into the Y2K zeitgeist, producing a string of avant-garde looks.

Her style weapon was a red lip, and she was rarely seen without a pair of killer heels as she graced the fashion circuit and flitted between red carpets. &nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>When she married Prince Harry, the Duchess was a vision of royal style perfection, donning tailored coat dresses and sophisticated, modest silhouettes.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>Since stepping away from royal duties, Meghan's former, refined style has since relaxed.
