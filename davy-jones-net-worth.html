Davy Jones earned his net worth and fame as a member of The Monkees. Davy Jones died unexpectedly at the age of 66 on February 29th 2012 in Florida. Jones left&nbsp;behind a wife and four daughters. Jones accumulated the vast bulk of his net worth as a member of The Monkees â€“ but was that as an actor or musician? It's difficult to say, since The Monkees are often considered to be not a "real" band, since they were conceived as the main characters on a TV sitcom. It's indisputable, however, that he began his career as an actor.</p><p>One of his first major gigs was appearing as The Artful Dodger in Oliver!, the musical based on the Charles Dickens novel Oliver Twist. In an amusing coincidence, Jones appeared on The <a href=# title="Ed Sullivan Net Worth">Ed Sullivan</a> Show with the rest of the Broadway cast of Oliver! on the same night that The Beatles famously appeared. Interesting, since the show that would later be Jones' greatest claim to fame was a sitcom riff on The Beatles. That show was The Monkees, which premiered in 1965, featured many songs with lead vocals from Davy Jones. The "band" disbanded after the show ended, but Jones continues to perform Monkees songs and has even dropped hints of a The Monkees reunion, although it is unknown what form this reunion would take if it did actually happen.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR70qKloJ2iqHylrdWyZKOnnprAbrrErWSwp6KptXA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./eliza-taylor-biography-wikipedia-net-worth-married-husband-age-height.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Eliza Taylor Biography, Wikipedia, Net Worth, Married, Husband, Age, Height</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./david-oakes-net-worth-details-about-wife-and-movies-tv-child-shows.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>David Oakes Net Worth: Details About Wife, and, Movies, TV, Child, Shows - SarkariResult</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./shows-alex-jones-delights-with-adorable-photo-of-mini-me-daughter-ann.html>Alex Jones delights with adorable photo of mini-me daughter Annie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alexandra-silva-wiki-age-bio-height.html>Alexandra Silva Wiki (Model) Age, Bio, Height, Weight, Net worth, Ethnicity, Boyfriend, Affairs &amp;amp; Fa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./becky-g-power-rangers-actor.html>Becky G Talks Gay 'Power Rangers' Character and Immigration</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beth-behrs-net-worth.html>Beth Behrs Net Worth 2024: Income, Real Estate and Financial Success</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chaunte-wayans.html>Chaunte Wayans Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Husband, Salary and Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib.
