So great to perform with my friends @davidfoster @katharinefoster and @thelondonessentials,” he captioned the post. McPhee wore a short white dress with spaghetti straps for the performance while Foster wore a white suit as he played the piano.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Katharine-McPhee-Returns-to-Stage-With-David-Foster-After-Nanny-s-Death-258.jpg><p>The show came nearly two weeks after McPhee announced that she would be missing the final two stops of her and Foster’s Asia tour due to a <a href=#>“horrible tragedy” in their family</a>. “At least one of us needs to get back home to our family,” the singer wrote via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> on August 11. Foster continued on with the final two performances which took place on August 11 and August 12 in Jakarta.</p><p>Calito, who was 55, died on August 9 after an 84-year-old woman at a Toyota car dealership drove a car into the customer reception area in San Fernando Valley, the Los Angeles Police Department said in a statement to Us Weekly on August 15. The driver, who has not been arrested in relation to Calito’s death, hit the gas instead of the brakes, reportedly pinning Calito under the vehicle and dragging her 20 feet. Calito was rushed to the hospital where she was pronounced dead.</p><p>Earlier this week, a source exclusively told Us that <a href=#>McPhee is “beyond devastated”</a> by the loss. “They were all very close and considered their nanny to be a part of the family,” the insider shared. “They are doing anything they can to support her family and are helping to make arrangements for her family or have at least offered to.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Katharine-McPhee-Returns-to-Stage-With-David-Foster-After-Nanny-s-Death-256.jpg><p>The source added that it’s “going to take a lot of time” for both McPhee and Calito’s family to “digest, heal and cope,” noting that McPhee is “not leaving her son’s side” in the wake of the tragedy. “Of course, he’s too young to absorb the reality of what happened, but it doesn’t take away from the pain that the situation has caused,” the insider said.</p><p>Although McPhee has not publicly addressed Calito’s death since announcing her absence from the Jakarta shows, <a href=#><strong>Megan Maybee</strong></a>, the car dealership’s director of communications, shared a statement with Us on August 17.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“We extend our deepest condolences to Yadira’s family, friends, and loved ones during this incredibly difficult time. The <a href=#>loss of such a vibrant life</a> in such tragic circumstances is a heavy burden to bear, and we share in their grief,” the statement began.</p><p>Maybee continued: “At Hamer Toyota, we take the safety of our customers and our community very seriously. We are fully cooperating with the Los Angeles Police Department as they conduct their investigation into this unfortunate event. Our commitment is to ensure transparency, assist the LAPD in every possible way, and to learn from this incident so we can prevent such tragedies in the future.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakmaSdrrO1zZ5kppugnbKmecairZ6rXWbAtXnPnqmfp6Kirq%2BvxGaqoqaTmnq0u82sZKeZnqPGtHnDnpitoF8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kim-do-wan-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kim Do Wan Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./joy-behar-jokes-that-barbara-walters-had-a-porn-smile.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Joy Behar Jokes that Barbara Walters Had a 'Porn' Smile</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./shows-alex-jones-delights-with-adorable-photo-of-mini-me-daughter-ann.html>Alex Jones delights with adorable photo of mini-me daughter Annie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alexandra-silva-wiki-age-bio-height.html>Alexandra Silva Wiki (Model) Age, Bio, Height, Weight, Net worth, Ethnicity, Boyfriend, Affairs &amp;amp; Fa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./becky-g-power-rangers-actor.html>Becky G Talks Gay 'Power Rangers' Character and Immigration</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beth-behrs-net-worth.html>Beth Behrs Net Worth 2024: Income, Real Estate and Financial Success</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chaunte-wayans.html>Chaunte Wayans Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Husband, Salary and Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib.
