When asked to spell the word narcissist, Will wrote down the name of fellow contestant <strong>Peter Izzo</strong>.</p><p>Will was named the winner of the Top Gun: Maverick challenge on the date and took home a Bachelorette bomber jacket, similar to the ones <a href=#>that the Naval aviators</a> wore in the movie. Peter later threw Will’s jacket in the pool during a confrontation back at the Bachelor Mansion.</p><p>Will was eliminated during the fourth week of The Bachelorette, but the jacket moment will live on forever.

Well, Will revealed that he gifted it to fellow Bachelor Nation member <a href=#><strong>Brandon Jones</strong></a>.</p><p>“I will always be your wingman!” Brandon shared via Instagram in January 2022, revealing that their friendship is still going strong since The Bachelorette. “Over & out.”</p><p>Will’s jacket debacle isn’t the only interesting thing about him.
