hawks against the doves<p>I took a job at the steaming way<br>Down on Caltrim St<br>Fell in love with a laundry girl<br>That was workin' next to me</p><p>Brown hair zig zagged across her face<br>And a look of half surprise<br>Like a fox caught in the headlights<br>There was animal in her eyes</p><p>She said to me<br>"Can't you see I'm not the factory kind?<br>If you don't take me out of here<br>I'll surely lose my mind"</p><p>She was a rare thing, fine as a bee's wing<br>So fine, a breath of wind might blow her away<br>She was a lost child, she was runnin' wild<br>(She said)<br>"So long as there's no price on love, I'll stay<br>You wouldn't want me any other way"</p><p>We busked around the market towns<br>Fruit pickin' down in Kent<br>We could tinker pots and pans<br>Or knives, wherever we went</p><p>We were campin' down the Gower one time<br>The work was mighty good<br>She wouldn't wait for the harvest<br>I thought we should</p><p>I said to her we'll settle down<br>Get a few acres dug<br>A fire burning in the hearth<br>And babies on the rug</p><p>She said, "Oh man, you foolish man<br>That surely sounds like hell<br>You might be lord of half the world<br>You'll not own me as well"</p><p>She was a rare thing, fine as a bee's wing<br>So fine, a breath of wind might blow her away<br>She was a lost child, she was runnin' wild<br>(She said)<br>"So long as there's no price on love, I'll stay<br>You wouldn't want me any other way"</p><p>We were drinking more in those days<br>Our tempers reached a pitch<br>Like a fool I let her run away<br>When she took the rambling itch</p><p>Last I heard she was living rough<br>Back on the Derby beat<br>A bottle of White Horse in her pocket<br>A Wolfhound at her feet</p><p>They say that she got married once<br>To a man called Romany Brown<br>Even a gypsy caravan<br>Was too much like settlin' down</p><p>They say her rose has faded<br>Rough weather and hard booze<br>Maybe that's the price you pay<br>For the chains that you refuse</p><p>She was a rare thing, fine as a bee's wing<br>I miss her more than ever, words can say<br>If I could just taste all of her wildness now<br>If I could hold her in my arms today<br>I wouldn't want her any other way</p><p class=postsid
