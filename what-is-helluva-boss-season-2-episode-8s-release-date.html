Amongst its fans, the show is notorious for long waits between episodes, with the first season averaging about a month between episodes. But the long waits have only gotten longer for the show’s second season, with the longest gap being almost five months between episodes two and three. The most recent episode of Helluva Boss to be released was the seventh one, which came out on Oct. 29, 2023.</p>Recommended Videos<h2 id=h-when-are-we-getting-helluva-boss-season-2-episode-8 data-injectable=false>When are we getting Helluva Boss season 2, episode 8?</h2><p data-characters=464 data-current-count=464 data-injectable=true>Fans have been dying to know when the next episode is set to drop ever since the creators seemingly teased a December release last year, after <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">making cryptic posts on X</a> (formerly Twitter). Sadly that wasn’t what the post was alluding to, with fans just getting the Just Look My Way music video, which was great but still, where is episode eight? Since then there really hasn’t been any word regarding a release date, so fans will just have to continue waiting.</p><p data-characters=318 data-current-count=318 data-injectable=false>At this point, fans have been waiting almost four months and that still isn’t the longest wait between an episode. It’s possible we could see episode eight in the next month or so, as that would take us up to nearly five months, but it’s almost impossible to predict based on the history of releases.</p><h2 id=h-why-does-it-take-so-long-between-each-episode data-injectable=false>Why does it take so long between each episode?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Helluva-Boss-season-2-e1708885831334.jpg><p data-characters=576 data-current-count=576 data-injectable=true>The second season is set to have 12 episodes, so at this rate, we might get to see the end of it by late 2025 and season 3 will likely finish sometime in the next century. All jokes aside there is a good reason for the long wait times between the episodes. In case you hadn’t noticed, Helluva Boss is an animated show; whilst a live-action project can be written, shot, and edited relatively fast, the same rules don’t apply to animated series. Clearly, there’s a lot of effort put into making it as good a quality show as humanly possible, so they can’t cut corners.</p><p data-characters=384 data-current-count=384 data-injectable=false>It’s the same reason <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">we had to wait so long for Invincible season 2</a> <strong>—</strong> you can’t rush perfection, and trust me, you wouldn’t want them to. You also have to bear in mind that, unlike Invincible, the creators behind Helluva Boss just aren’t as big or well-funded; each episode airs on YouTube and it’s more likely something akin to a passion project for many of them.</p><p data-characters=693 data-current-count=1077 data-injectable=false>But the waits weren’t as long between episodes in season one, so why is season 2 taking so much longer? The answer to that is that the show’s creator, Vivziepop, has other projects on the go. Helluva Boss is actually part of a shared universe known as the “Hellaverse” of which <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hazbin Hotel is also a part</a>. That show began its first season in January 2024 and it’s safe to assume the creators have been working on the show in the background for months or even years. Working on two animated shows at the same time is bound to slow down the pace and although it sucks that we have to wait so long, at least we have another show to tide us over until episode eight finally arrives.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMCtZKKrXZ2yrbjUr5hmmp%2BowG6%2FxJqqqKZdZ3qmvMispp2dXW3Abr7EpZyaq5VisaLAxGg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jamel-johnson-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What is Jamel Johnson Net Worth 2024: Wiki, Age, Weight, Height, Relationships, And More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./erno-dohnanyi-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What is Erno Dohnanyi Net Worth 2024: Bio, Age, Height, Family, Music Style, And More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./shows-alex-jones-delights-with-adorable-photo-of-mini-me-daughter-ann.html>Alex Jones delights with adorable photo of mini-me daughter Annie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alexandra-silva-wiki-age-bio-height.html>Alexandra Silva Wiki (Model) Age, Bio, Height, Weight, Net worth, Ethnicity, Boyfriend, Affairs &amp;amp; Fa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./becky-g-power-rangers-actor.html>Becky G Talks Gay 'Power Rangers' Character and Immigration</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beth-behrs-net-worth.html>Beth Behrs Net Worth 2024: Income, Real Estate and Financial Success</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chaunte-wayans.html>Chaunte Wayans Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Husband, Salary and Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib.
