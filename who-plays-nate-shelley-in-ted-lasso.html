We’ve loved following the majority of the ensemble in and around the AFC Richmond Football Club as they eventually gravitate towards the titular coach’s relentless optimism, all the while Lasso (Jason Sudeikis) himself heartbreakingly struggles with his own demons.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=371 data-current-count=371 data-injectable=false>Whether it be the infamous Roy Kent (Brett Goldstein) or calculated <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Club President Rebecca Welton</a> (Hannah Waddingham), in time, there is nary a character in the Emmy-winning series that can resist Lasso’s brand of team-building and outward positive energy. That is until we get to Nathan “Nate” Shelley – who is a little bit of an enigma in that regard.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=398 data-current-count=769 data-injectable=true>Ted’s impact on Nate’s life is arguably one of the more profound character developments in the series, with the manager having seen his potential from day one, plucking him from the humble role of kit man and onto his coaching staff. However, Nate eventually finds himself struggling with his newfound confidence and rise to prominence, ultimately finding himself at odds with his mentor.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=306 data-current-count=306 data-injectable=false>Nate’s arc throughout the Ted Lasso series is perhaps one of the more complex matters to unpack – and it takes a heck of an actor to whip our impression of their character back and forth from love, to hate, and everywhere in between. So, who is the man who brings life to the kit man turned Wonder Kid?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-nate-shelley-actor-in-ted-lasso data-injectable=false>Nate Shelley actor in Ted Lasso</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/nick-mohammed-nathan-shelley-ted-lasso-2.png><p data-characters=468 data-current-count=468 data-injectable=true>Nate Shelley is played by Leeds-born English actor <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nick Mohammed</a>. He has been nominated for two primetime Emmys for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series for his role in Ted Lasso in 2021 and 2022, but lost out on both occasions to his equally impressive co-star, Brett Goldstein – who brings life to Roy Kent in the same series. He did, however, manage to share a SAG award with his castmates for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series.</p><p data-characters=331 data-current-count=331 data-injectable=false>Outside of his work on Ted Lasso, Mohammed is also known for his roles in The Martian, Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie, The Sense of an Ending, and Bridget Jones’s Baby.
