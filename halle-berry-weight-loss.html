"During quarantine, I've been focusing a lot on self-care and started working out at home," she says. "Which is why the partnership with FitOn and rē*spin is so fitting. One of my favorite workouts on the app is the rē*spin Plyo Agility."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/shutterstock_670209337.jpg><p><span>Berry revealed some of her favorite workouts to </span><i><span>InStyle.</span></i><span> "It always varies! Over the past few years, I went from training for </span><i><span>John Wick 3</span></i><span> to my upcoming film and directorial debut </span><i><span>BRUISED</span></i><span>. Some days I'd work on strength and cardio and others I'd do yoga and stretching, all while I did a few hours of martial arts training each day."</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/05/GettyImages-1473151554.jpg><p><span>In addition to working out, Berry also prioritizes her recovery. She tells </span><i><span>InStyle</span></i><span> that she likes to take cold showers as a form of recovery. "For me, it's been important not to overstress my body. Taking cold hot showers has been a good recovery ritual." </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>UCLA Health</span></a><span> states, "</span><span>Going from a hot to cold shower — even for a couple of minutes — might protect you from circulating viruses. The shock of cold water can stimulate the blood cells that fight off infection (leukocytes). One </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>study</span></a><span> in the Netherlands found that people who switched to cold showers for 30, 60, or 90 seconds for 90 days called out sick from work 29% less than people who didn't switch to cold showers."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/06/shutterstock_1071753365.jpg><p><span>Berry tells </span><i><span>InStyle </span></i><span>that she likes to intermittent fast each day. "I can't skip my Bulletproof coffee each morning," she revealed. "It allows me to fast until 2 or 3 pm." </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>John Hopkins Medicine </span></a><span>states that intermittent fasting has a lot of benefits. "Studies discovered that intermittent fasting boosts working memory in animals and verbal memory in adult humans.

"I've also found that taking care of my mental health has been crucial during these odd times. I just launched my Journal on Joy at rē·spin which is part of my bedtime routine. It is a space to record memories that make you smile and helps me focus on positivity and gratitude. Also reading self-help books on ways to stay grounded and centered during this time has been widely helpful and inspirational."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/05/GettyImages-1385062604.jpg><p><span>For Berry, living a healthy lifestyle is important to her. "I was a gymnast growing up and was physically active at a young age," she tells </span><i><span>InStyle.</span></i><span> "At 22, I was diagnosed with diabetes and it became critical for me to manage my nutrition and diet. It really transformed my life and taught me how valuable my body is."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/06/shutterstock_630547955-1.jpg><p><span>Berry opened up about some of her favorite exercises with </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><i><span>Women's Health</span></i></a><i><span>. </span></i><span>"One abs move I do incorporate into my workouts pretty often is planks. I never did planks back in the day, but they've made a huge difference for my core strength and definition. Sometimes, I'll just hold a plank for as long as I can. My abs start to ache first, but pretty soon my entire body feels like it's on fire."</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifKmty6WcZpqVp7%2B6edaeoKCgpGK5sL%2FSaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./100-most-influential-people-2019.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Adam Bowen and James Monsees Are on the 2019 TIME 100 List</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tv-shows-like-netflix-you.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>5 TV Shows Like You That Will Give You The Chills</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./shows-alex-jones-delights-with-adorable-photo-of-mini-me-daughter-ann.html>Alex Jones delights with adorable photo of mini-me daughter Annie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alexandra-silva-wiki-age-bio-height.html>Alexandra Silva Wiki (Model) Age, Bio, Height, Weight, Net worth, Ethnicity, Boyfriend, Affairs &amp;amp; Fa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./becky-g-power-rangers-actor.html>Becky G Talks Gay 'Power Rangers' Character and Immigration</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beth-behrs-net-worth.html>Beth Behrs Net Worth 2024: Income, Real Estate and Financial Success</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chaunte-wayans.html>Chaunte Wayans Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Husband, Salary and Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib.
