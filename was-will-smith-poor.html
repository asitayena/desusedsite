He admitted being </strong><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>“quietly broke”</strong></a><strong> during his first three years of </strong><strong>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</strong><strong>, because he used the majority of his paychecks to </strong><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>cover the taxes</strong></a><strong> that he failed to pay in time.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Self-Made Star</h2><p>Will Smith can proudly call himself self-made, because he <a href=# rel=noopener>wasn’t born into a rich family</a>. His mother Caroline was a school board administrator, while his father worked as refrigeration engineer after serving in the US Air Forces. They didn’t have an abundance of money, but still sent Will and his siblings<a href=# rel=noopener> to private catholic school</a> Our Lady of Lourdes, because good education came first.</p><p>He later attended public Overbrook High School, but didn’t go to college afterwards – not because he couldn’t afford it, but because he<a href=# rel=noopener> “wanted to rap”</a> instead. Smith claimed that he was recruited by MIT, but decided not to apply for college, and told<a href=# rel=noopener> Wired</a> that he “would have made a billion dollars and been broke by now” if he made a different choice.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Money Troubles</h2><p>Will Smith never made a billion bucks, but he still managed to end up broke. He found huge success during the late ‘80s as a member of the hip-hop duo DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince, and<a href=# rel=noopener> made approximately $10 million</a> by the time 1990 rolled around.</p><p>He was spending money like there’s no tomorrow, and showered his friends and family with gifts – until the IRS came knocking on his door. It turned out that<a href=# rel=noopener> Smith failed to pay $2.8 million</a> in taxes, and he no longer had enough money to cover his debt. He wasn’t making enough money from music, so he had to find another source of income ASAP.</p><p>Despite the fact he had zero acting experience, Smith accepted the lead role on the NBC sitcom<a href=# rel=noopener> The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</a>. His troubles were far from over, because <a href=# rel=noopener>the IRS was taking 70%</a> of his paychecks for three years before his debt was finally paid.</p><p>“Being famous and broke is a sh—y combination, because you’re still famous and people recognize you, but they recognize you while you’re sitting next to them on the bus,” explained Smith in one of his YouTube videos.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Current Net Worth</h2><p>There was a time when Will Smith struggled financially, but he’ll probably never have to do it again. <a href=# rel=noopener>His net worth</a> was estimated at $350 million in 2019, and he owes most of his fortune to his enormous movie paychecks.</p><p>It’s been reported that he received a <a href=# rel=noopener>performance-based salary</a> of $100 million for the role in Men in Black 3 alone, making him one of the highest-paid actors in the movie history. He’s still one of the rare actors who have enough star power to sell pretty much any project, and the fact that he’s great at hyping up his movies on social media doesn’t hurt his case.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Some people would argue that Smith is past his prime, but his paychecks aren’t getting any smaller.<a href=# rel=noopener> Forbes</a> reported that he received $20 million to appear in Netflix film Bright,<a href=# rel=noopener> opening the doors</a> for other A-list stars to ask the streaming giant for hefty paychecks.</p><p>Appearing in Aladdin was also a great decision from the financial standpoint, and he ended up receiving $12.5 million and “a strong backend cut” according to<a href=# rel=noopener> Hollywood Reporter</a>. The future is also looking bright for Smith, since he’s expected to earn $20 million for starring in<a href=# rel=noopener> King Richard</a>, and another $35 million for reprising his role in the<a href=# rel=noopener> Bright sequel</a>.</p><p>The two-time Oscar nominee can also count on the money that he’s earning through other business endeavors – including production company<a href=# rel=noopener> Overbrook Entertainment</a>, clothing brand<a href=# rel=noopener> Bel-Air Athletics</a>, eco-friendly startup<a href=# rel=noopener> Just Water</a>,&nbsp; and multimedia platform<a href=# rel=noopener> Westbrook Inc.</a></p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jrCYrGWnnrmtedKmoK2gXaW8sL6O</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kristin-chenoweth-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What is Kristin Chenoweth Net Worth 2024: Income, Philanthropy, Investments and Business Ventures</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-problem-with-the-red-and-dorothy-love-story.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The problem with the Red and Dorothy love story on Once Upon a Time</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./shows-alex-jones-delights-with-adorable-photo-of-mini-me-daughter-ann.html>Alex Jones delights with adorable photo of mini-me daughter Annie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alexandra-silva-wiki-age-bio-height.html>Alexandra Silva Wiki (Model) Age, Bio, Height, Weight, Net worth, Ethnicity, Boyfriend, Affairs &amp;amp; Fa</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./becky-g-power-rangers-actor.html>Becky G Talks Gay 'Power Rangers' Character and Immigration</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beth-behrs-net-worth.html>Beth Behrs Net Worth 2024: Income, Real Estate and Financial Success</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chaunte-wayans.html>Chaunte Wayans Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Husband, Salary and Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVib.
